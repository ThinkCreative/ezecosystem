      <p>When we were trying to figure out <b>the task for BEST Code Challenge competition</b>, we strived to make the task most interesting for students. Looking back now, I think we succeeded. Also,&nbsp;It is always a pleasure working with students. Students are always full of mind blowing ideas, giving us completely different perspective of challenges we are facing every day. Also,&nbsp;</p><p>The task for this edition of BEST Code Challenge was simply called: <b>“Mobile experience BEST.hr”</b>. It had three focuses:</p>
<ol>

<li><b>Mobile</b> - the application should be built for mobile phones a.k.a. smartphones, either native - iOS, Android, Windows Phone 7 or mobile website.</li>

<li><b>Experience</b> - main focus of the task was User Experience. We wanted to stress out the importance of User Experience when developing applications.</li>

<li><b>BEST.hr</b> - we provided JSON and RSS APIs to students, giving them all the data they might need from BEST.hr website.</li>

</ol>
<p>The competition kicked off on 13th March and lasted for 10 days. In those 10 days, we were communicating with students as much as we could, trying to give them all the extra information they asked for and answering to all of their questions.&nbsp;</p><p>
After the deadline for submitting solutions, all the work was back on us. Most of the solutions were really good and definitely qualified for first few places. Now we needed to choose the best application. It was hard to pick the best application since the platforms are rather different and hard to compare. We took the challenge, taking into consideration all platform specific guidelines and focusing on usability and user experience.<br />There were seven of us working together in groups of 2-3, talking over Skype. It was a great experience for me, having the change to work in such an environment, with these companies:</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="http://www.netgen.hr/eng/Netgen" target="_self">Netgen</a> - web development and user experience oriented</li>

<li><a href="http://it4u.com.hr" target="_self">IT4U</a> - mobile development oriented, covering all three major mobile platforms</li>

<li><a href="http://uxpassion.com" target="_self">UX Passion</a> - user experience experts</li>

</ul>
<p>
At the end of the day, we agreed on the winner and chose second and third place as well.<br />Next morning, student organization BEST, organized official closing of the competition and winner announcement. We proclaimed <b><a href="http://svenkapudija.com" target="_self">Sven Kapuđija</a> as the winner of BEST Code Challenge v2.0!</b> His application was a notch better than other and we all agreed he deserves to be the winner.</p><p>Here are screenshots of first four applications just so you can get the idea how good some applications were.</p><table class="default" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="100%" summary="winner"><tr><td valign="top">

      <p>I love working on web projects and I love working at Netgen. And here are a few reasons why I think that you could also love web work (and possibly consider working at Netgen, as we are always looking for quality people).</p><a name="eztoc8207_1" id="eztoc8207_1"></a><h2>Diversity</h2><p>We at Netgen do “web stuff”. It is a quite broad field of work, so much that we had to have multi day conversations just to put online our <a href="http://www.netgen.hr/eng/What-we-do" target="_self">“what we do” page</a>. Working in a web agency gives one a rare occasion to be involved in such wide range of activities that anyone who wants to have a career out of it can really pick and choose. Starting from analysts figuring out client's business priorities and needs, through designers working on ideas and visual designs and finally developers materialising the solution in code and working website, every project is a different journey. And in Netgen, we all like travelling.&nbsp;</p><a name="eztoc8207_2" id="eztoc8207_2"></a><h2>Solving problems</h2><p>Whenever we are called (and paid) to do work, we are solving someones problem. Sometimes it is a new site that helps a great company to present itself and make connection to clients, sometimes it is a mind boggling technical problem that has been a stone in someones shoe for a long time. Whatever you do in Netgen, there is a good chance that someone will be very grateful in the end. And usually, the most rewarding part of project is the recognition that you get for making that difference in someones business (or life in general).</p><a name="eztoc8207_3" id="eztoc8207_3"></a><h2>Creativity</h2><p>Given a 24hour time span of a day, and a necessary 8 (humm...) hour sleep, your work will take up to half of your conscious time. And for me, there would be nothing worse than spending it in a dull and uninspiring place. Putting aside occasional paperwork that is still a part of every company existence, most of the work we do demands a creative approach. Either while drawing sketches on paper, coding HTML / PHP or pixel pushing in Photoshop, every day brings new and different kinds of challenges that need to be overcome. Good!</p><a name="eztoc8207_4" id="eztoc8207_4"></a><h2>Community</h2><p>On a smaller scale it is the people that share the office with you. On the large scale it is the <a href="http://share.ez.no" target="_self">people that use eZ Publish</a> or general web development / web design community. In each case it is great to belong to a group that has such a culture of sharing and recognizing the quality of other people work. In Netgen, we want to have a sense of belonging and comradeship both internally in the company, and when being involved in broader community. That is why we are actively <a href="http://www.netgen.hr/eng/Labs" target="_self">sharing our work</a> and <a href="http://ezsummercamp.com/" target="_self">working on initiatives</a> that strengthen the ties between companies and individuals. Join in!</p><a name="eztoc8207_5" id="eztoc8207_5"></a><h2>Passion</h2><p>At the end, it all falls back to passion. Just take a look around and you will find great examples of people or businesses that flourish on making their everyday work their passion too. Globally, there are PR / social media gurus like <a href="http://garyvaynerchuk.com/" target="_self">Gary Vaynerchuck</a>, developers like <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/22656/jon-skeet" target="_self">Jon Skeet</a> or designers like <a href="http://boagworld.com/" target="_self">Paul Boag</a>. More close to you, it could be that CSS or PHP wizard that spends that extra hour to make his work the best it can be. The passion always shines through, and in Netgen we are very serious about our work.&nbsp;</p><p>If you feel the same about developing or/and designing for the web, and are looking a place to make your fun your daily bread, <a href="http://www.netgen.hr/eng/Contact" target="_self">give us a call</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>You know we will be excited to talk!&nbsp;</p>

I hope students will recognize it and implement the solutions according to our suggestions.</p><p>Let me explain in more details why have we chosen this kind of task.

<ul>

<li><b>Mobile</b> is cool, mobile is sexy, mobile is soon to be more important than desktop. There is already a need for good mobile developers. So to stay in touch with the present and prepare for the future we want to see how students are able to respond to this need. To give the student enough choices following platforms are allowed: Android, iOS, Win7 for mobile apps and HTML5/CSS3/JS for mobile web.</li>

<li>
<b>Experience</b> is more difficult to explain but also the most important requirement. We have seen a great shift in experience in last decade from slow, overbloated and ugly desktop applications to simple, slick and fast web solutions. On mobile phones user experience is even more important by the nature of the medium. Small screens require special care of space usage, availabitly of actions buttons etc. People are used to have what they want as fast as possible. And they want to feel good about it. A slow, buggy, ugly and confusing interface is not welcome any more.&nbsp;<br /><i>"The Devil is in the details"</i></li>

<li>Last but not least is the domain of the student organiziation which organizes the competition: <b>BEST.hr</b>. Our strong opinion is that the task should <b>produce something useful</b>&nbsp;that can be used later on. There is a chance that any of the submited solutions could be used as a real mobile interface for the BEST.hr domain. To go even further with that students should use JSON feed directly from that domain to get the content. So once deployed solution is going to be integrated well.&nbsp;</li>

</ul>
<p><b>Let the best students win :)</b></p>

In my humble opinion Lisbon was a bulls-eye decision due to the beautiful weather (sunny with almost 15 degrees Celsius) while most other parts of Europe were covered with snow and under freezing -15 degrees Celsius :). It was a great pleasure to enjoy the sun and discuss the future of eZ with other attendees.</p><p>Back to the eZ stuff.&nbsp;</p><p>Before writing this post I referenced <a href="http://www.netgen.hr/eng/Blog/eZ-Winter-Conference-2011-in-Nice-Summary" target="_self">the summary post from last years eZ Winter Conference</a>&nbsp;because the current CEO of <a href="http://ez.no" target="_self">eZ Systems</a>&nbsp;Gabriele Viebach took charge few month before that event and Nice was her first general introduction to eZ Community.

The shift started few years back and a big step was the split between the Community Edition and the Enterprise Edition. Last year we missed some good reasons why would the big clients use eZ Publish CMS Enterprise Edition. In my opinion support and maintenance was just not enough and I heard the same conclusion from other community members.</p><p>During the 2011 eZ Systems bought 2 companies: <b><a href="http://www.yoochoose.com" target="_self">Yoochoose</a></b> (recommendation engine service) and <b><a href="http://www.odoscope.com/%20" target="_self">Odoscope</a></b> (web analytics and optimization service). &nbsp;The plan in motion is to deeply integrate those 2 services in the Enterprise Edition to give a noticeable added value: <b>tools that can be used for increasing customer experience</b>. Of course, those are just 2 pieces in a bigger puzzle.&nbsp;</p><p>Last year <b><a href="http://ez.no/Products/eZ-Market" target="_self">eZ Market</a></b> was introduced. &nbsp;Maybe the wording was bad, but our first impressions were that eZ Systems wants to build something like the App Store where people can put their extension and sell them to the general public. After Lisbon <b>intentions of eZ Systems should be clear: they want partners and the community to build innovative extensions and sell them exclusively to their Enterprise clients with support included</b>. Knowing that they can’t develop all the new cool features for the ever-growing market, eZ Systems calls the community to participate.

The path is chosen and we shall see in a year or two was it the right one.&nbsp;</p><p>It is important to note that <b>there will always be the Community Edition of eZ Publish and community contributions that go with it</b>. Those are <b>giving a crucial advantage over closed source solutions in terms of innovation, education and crowdsourcing</b>, so eZ Systems needs to continue to nurture them with care. Also, an important thing is that the added value for the Enterprise clients (apart from maintenance and support) is provided through the eZ Market system, and the kernel is shared between Community and Enterprise Edition.

      <p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p>As you have probably realized by now, we are delving deeper into the PHP side of eZ Publish as this series of articles progresses. And that is a good thing, because until now, you have been limited to creating sites using the default eZ Publish functionalities. Which is enough for certain types of sites, and certain types of clients. But, as it is true in every line of work, clients tend to always ask for more. And a good programmer is ready for each and every type of situation.</p><p>This will be an extensive article covering the creation of custom database tables and explaining how to work with them in PHP. Therefore, the terms “object” and “class” we’ll be using in the rest of this article don’t refer to the eZ Publish objects and classes, but to the PHP ones.</p><a name="eztoc7120_1" id="eztoc7120_1"></a><h2>Creating custom database tables and manipulating them</h2><a name="eztoc7120_1_1" id="eztoc7120_1_1"></a><h3>What is the theory behind all of this?</h3><p>eZ Publish uses classes which extend the <b>eZPersistentObject</b> class to manipulate data in the database tables. One class per database table. The instances of this class (and all of those which extend the <b>eZPersistentObject</b> class) represent a row which is stored inside a table.</p><p>Now, the <b>eZPersistentObject</b> class represents a handy tool (or a set of tools, if you will) which enables us to manipulate the data in a table without the need od writing SQL queries all the time. Which is really great, because we are protected from SQL injection that way, also.</p><p>So, I will show you what the proper steps are in creating and manipulating a new database table for your project in the rest of this article.</p><a name="eztoc7120_1_2" id="eztoc7120_1_2"></a><h3>Creation of a database table</h3><p>Let’s say, for example, that you have set up a small web-shop and now you need to create some promotional discount codes for the users in order to make your products even more approachable. Those discount codes don’t always work, however, because you intend to apply them on certain dates or on certain periods of time.</p><p>The first thing we need to do is to create a table in our database which will store our discount codes. This table will need at least four fields: the discount code itself, the date when discount code validity starts, the date when discount code validity ends, and the percentage of the discount applied. We’ll also need an ID which will serve as the primary key on this table.</p><p>Create a new table like so:</p><pre>CREATE TABLE discount_code (
id INT(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
discount_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
valid_from INT(11) NOT NULL,
valid_to INT(11) NOT NULL,
discount_amount FLOAT NOT NULL
);</pre><p>And there you have it, the structure of your table is ready. So, what did we do with this MySQL statement? Well, first off, we told SQL that we want to define a new table in our site’s database called discount_code. In it we’ve defined the structure we outlined in this article. So, we have a primary key called id, the name of our discount code called discount_name, values for the dates of the start and end of validity for our code, and the percentage we wish for our code to have.</p><a name="eztoc7120_1_3" id="eztoc7120_1_3"></a><h3>Manipulating the data in our custom database table</h3><p>After we’ve outlined our database table in this manner, we need to create its PHP class so that we can manipulate the data in the table itself. But before we actually create this class, let’s take a look at what we need to do with the rows in our table. We need to be able to create them, store any changes we might apply to them, and we need to be able to fetch those codes in a certain manner.</p><p>In regards to creation, storage and removal of rows of data, the <b>eZPersistentObject</b> class already has some methods which can help you in those tasks. As for the fetching the data, we need to determine what kind of fetches we need to implement. So, let’s say that we need to be able to fetch a table row by its ID, by its name, and a list of all the rows in a table. After that, we also need to know how many rows have already been created, and let’s say that we need to know if a row is actually applicable so that it can be used.</p><p>
We will create a class which extends the <b>eZPersistentObject</b> class, and its instances (objects) will manipulate the data in our table. We will put it in the classes folder of the module we have created before. <br />&nbsp;If you don’t have a <b>classes</b> folder for your module (for all intents and purposes, I’ll assume that it’s the <b>mymodule</b> we created earlier), please create it now. So, go to <b>extension/myextension/classes</b> folder and in it create a PHP file called <b>mydiscountcode.php</b>.</p><p>Open <b>mydiscountcode.php</b> and insert the following lines of code in it:</p><pre><?php&nbsp;
class myDiscountCode extends eZPersistentObject
{

function __construct($row)
{
parent::__construct($row);
}

static function definition()
{
return array(
'fields' => array( 'id'=>array('name'=>'ID', 'datatype'=>'integer', 'default'=>0, 'required'=>true),
'discount_name '=>array('name'=>'DiscountName', 'datatype'=>'string', 'default' => '', 'required' => true),
'valid_from'=>array('name'=>'ValidFrom', 'datatype'=>'integer', 'default'=>0, 'required'=>true),
'valid_to'=>array('name'=>'ValidTo', 'datatype' => 'integer', 'default' &nbsp;=> 0, 'required' => true),
'discount_amount'=>array('name'=>'DiscountAmount', 'datatype' => 'float', 'default' => 0, 'required' => true)
),
'keys' => array('id'),
'class_name' => 'myDiscountCode',
'sort' => array('valid_from' => 'desc'),
'name' => 'discount_code'
);
}

function isValid()
{
$currentTimeStamp = time();
if ( $currentTimeStamp >= (int) $this->attribute('valid_from') && $currentTimeStamp < (int) $this->attribute('valid_to') )
return true;
return false;
}

static function fetch($id)
{
return eZPersistentObject::fetchObject(self::definition(), null, array('id' => (int) $id));
}

static function fetchByDiscountName($discountName)
{
return eZPersistentObject::fetchObject(self::definition(), null, array( 'discount_name' => trim($discountCode) ) );
}

static function fetchCount()
{
return eZPersistentObject::count(self::definition());
}

static function fetchList($conds = null, $limit = null)
{
return eZPersistentObject::fetchObjectList(self::definition(), null, $conds, null, $limit);
}

?></pre><p>As you can see, we have defined a class called <b>myDiscountCode</b> which extends the already existing <b>eZPersistentObject</b> class. The constructor used here is very simple and just calls the constructor of the parent class to do the initialization for us. Also, most of the code here is reused from the <b>eZPersistentObject</b> class because it already has most of the functionalities we need.</p><p>Each and every class extending <b>eZPersistentObject</b> class has a <b>definition()</b> method which returns a single associative array. But it’s an important one because with this array, eZ Publish knows which table from the database to use, and what attributes/properties of a class to link with what values in the table we’ve defined before. Let’s break this array down to its fundamental elements.</p><p>It consists of five keys: <b>fields</b>, <b>function_attributes</b>, <b>keys</b>, <b>class_name</b>, <b>sort</b> and <b>name</b>. The <b>fields</b> key is the link from the class attributes to their respective database columns, and it’s also an associative array of values. As you can see, each attribute needs to have some information on which it is based. So, we need to define its name, its datatype, a default value, and whether it’s required or not. All of these, except the name, need to match the properties of the corresponding database column. On the other hand, for the name value you can assign any value you want.</p><p>The <b>keys</b> key is an array of fields used to uniquely define each row in our table. Since our table has a primary key called <b>id</b>, and it’s unique, this is the value we want the <b>keys</b> array to have.</p><p>The <b>class_name</b> key is the name of our class which extends the <b>eZPersistentObject</b> class.</p><p>The <b>sort</b> key is the default sorting mechanism you use when fetching table rows. In here we have said that we wish to sort our discount codes by using the <b>valid_from</b> attribute, descending, which means that the newest date in the database will be first, and the oldest one last.</p><p>And, finally, the <b>name</b> key contains the name of the actual database table we store our data in.</p><p>After we have created the definition array, we need to fill our class with some methods to work with our data.</p><p>So, the first method is the <b>isValid()</b> method, which checks the validity of the discount code in question. As you can see, it checks the current time, and if the current time is between the <b>valid_from</b> and <b>valid_to</b> times, it returns a value of <b>true</b>. Otherwise, it will return a <b>false</b> value.</p><p>After that, we have defined a static <b>fetch()</b> method which fetches the discount codes by their ids and returns the array of instances of our class. Each instance wraps one row from the database table. In here we actually use the inherited <b>eZPersistentObject</b> method called <b>fetchObject()</b> which accepts the following values: the definition array (which we created earlier), some field filters (which is currently set to null because we have no filters to apply - these filters are used only if you want to fetch some of the records from the database table), and the conditions by which we want to fetch our discount code (which in this case is defined by the array that specifies the ID of the row to fetch).</p><p>Since our table is fairly simple, all other methods also use methods from the <b>eZPersistentObject</b> class. You can find a full reference to the <b>eZPersistentObject</b> class <a href="http://pubsvn.ez.no/doxygen/trunk/html/classeZPersistentObject.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p>Since this is such a major topic, I’m going to end today’s article on this note. We will explore how to use instances of our class in eZ Publish templates.</p><p>
Until next time, I wish you happy coding,<br />Tomislav</p>

<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">?></span></pre><p>As you can see, we have defined a class called <b>myDiscountCode</b> which extends the already existing <b>eZPersistentObject</b> class. The constructor used here is very simple and just calls the constructor of the parent class to do the initialization for us. Also, most of the code here is reused from the <b>eZPersistentObject</b> class because it already has most of the functionalities we need.</p><p>Each and every class extending <b>eZPersistentObject</b> class has a <b>definition()</b> method which returns a single associative array. But it’s an important one because with this array, eZ Publish knows which table from the database to use, and what attributes/properties of a class to link with what values in the table we’ve defined before. Let’s break this array down to its fundamental elements.</p><p>It consists of five keys: <b>fields</b>, <b>function_attributes</b>, <b>keys</b>, <b>class_name</b>, <b>sort</b> and <b>name</b>. The <b>fields</b> key is the link from the class attributes to their respective database columns, and it’s also an associative array of values. As you can see, each attribute needs to have some information on which it is based. So, we need to define its name, its datatype, a default value, and whether it’s required or not. All of these, except the name, need to match the properties of the corresponding database column. On the other hand, for the name value you can assign any value you want.</p><p>The <b>keys</b> key is an array of fields used to uniquely define each row in our table. Since our table has a primary key called <b>id</b>, and it’s unique, this is the value we want the <b>keys</b> array to have.</p><p>The <b>class_name</b> key is the name of our class which extends the <b>eZPersistentObject</b> class.</p><p>The <b>sort</b> key is the default sorting mechanism you use when fetching table rows. In here we have said that we wish to sort our discount codes by using the <b>valid_from</b> attribute, descending, which means that the newest date in the database will be first, and the oldest one last.</p><p>And, finally, the <b>name</b> key contains the name of the actual database table we store our data in.</p><p>After we have created the definition array, we need to fill our class with some methods to work with our data.</p><p>So, the first method is the <b>isValid()</b> method, which checks the validity of the discount code in question. As you can see, it checks the current time, and if the current time is between the <b>valid_from</b> and <b>valid_to</b> times, it returns a value of <b>true</b>. Otherwise, it will return a <b>false</b> value.</p><p>After that, we have defined a static <b>fetch()</b> method which fetches the discount codes by their ids and returns the array of instances of our class. Each instance wraps one row from the database table. In here we actually use the inherited <b>eZPersistentObject</b> method called <b>fetchObject()</b> which accepts the following values: the definition array (which we created earlier), some field filters (which is currently set to null because we have no filters to apply - these filters are used only if you want to fetch some of the records from the database table), and the conditions by which we want to fetch our discount code (which in this case is defined by the array that specifies the ID of the row to fetch).</p><p>Since our table is fairly simple, all other methods also use methods from the <b>eZPersistentObject</b> class. You can find a full reference to the <b>eZPersistentObject</b> class <a href="http://pubsvn.ez.no/doxygen/trunk/html/classeZPersistentObject.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p>Since this is such a major topic, I’m going to end today’s article on this note. We will explore how to use instances of our class in eZ Publish templates.</p><p>
Until next time, I wish you happy coding,<br />Tomislav</p>

      <p><i>(If you missed the blog on the Future Direction of eZ,&nbsp;<a href="http://ez.no/About-eZ/Blog/The-Future-Direction-of-eZ" target="_self">read all about it here.</a>)</i></p><p>In a world where relatively “newborn” digital companies are turning industries upside down, the media industry is an obvious example: traditional, print-based media groups are struggling to digitize their business models while facing the challenge of new companies that were not there ten years ago.</p><p>As the most used content management platform in the media industry, we are working closely both with new pure digital media companies as well as with these traditional media groups.</p><p>While the media is discussing “digital first” or “mobile first” and other strategies to lead this transformation, we see the same trend in just about any vertical. New customer habits combined with new players make traditional business methods more challenging, while simultaneously creating huge opportunities for those who recognize and embrace them. Retail, travel and financial services are examples of the industries affected.</p><p>Thus, I believe that in the digital economy of the future, every company in any vertical is a publisher and needs to think like a media company - and content is the key driver of their success.</p><a name="eztoc391251_1" id="eztoc391251_1"></a><h2>Why?</h2><p>With changing customer habits, the buying process is moving into the digital realm. The right content about your product or services, from the right source, available through the right channel, is key to obtaining a buying decision.</p><p>So what can we learn from the media industry? For any successful digital business, you need to ensure:</p><p>#1:&nbsp;That you can involve any person, within your company or outside, in your publishing process in a simple, social, but controlled way.</p><div class="separator"><span></span></div><p>#2:&nbsp;That you can utilize the power of all types of content - be it text, film or pictures - from any source, such as your ERP, Document Management or CRM.</p><div class="separator"><span></span></div><p>#3:&nbsp;That you can publish your content in any of today’s channels - mobile, web, print, tablet, social - and more importantly, the channels of the future.</p><div class="separator"><span></span></div><p>
Content is Gold, and is the basis of any successful digital business model, today and in the future.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
At eZ we will not forget this, even while everybody runs after the next hyped trend. eZ will continue to focus on creating great content management software, making sure anyone can create any type of content and publish it in any channel - of today and in the future - and providing tools to optimize this content lifecycle.<br />
&nbsp;<br />Just as in your digital business, we treat Content as Gold, and create the tools to help new, fully digital and traditional businesses remain successful, for today and tomorrow.</p>

      <p>So there is one thing that is sure about eZ Publish 5, and certainly understated: <b>eZ Publish 5 is the way to go for top-notch performance!</b></p><p>It has always been clear, speaking about traditional Content Management Systems (CMS), including eZ Publish 3 &amp; 4: making these systems run fast under heavy load was a true challenge. This was sometime a very critical topic for anyone running high-traffic apps. Well, we should may be say it more clearly and loudly: eZ Publish Platform 5 and further solve this issue, thanks to its architecture and the way it integrates the Symfony2 framework. Release after release, this will keep improving. If you have a high-traffic site to build and think using a CMS will not make it for the sake of performance, you should probably reconsider your position before reinventing the wheel.</p><p>Hereafter are a few facts that our benchmark are showing to better understand how eZ Publish evolve in that respect.</p><p>(to better understand the last part of it, you might want to make sure you understand the dual-kernel architecture of eZ Publish 5 which is for instance <a href="https://confluence.ez.no/x/kgGu" title="Confluence - eZ Architecture" target="_blank">introduced here</a>.</p><a name="eztoc390149_1" id="eztoc390149_1"></a><h2>Sites based on the &quot;New Stack&quot;are breaking the barrier</h2><p>By “New Stack”, we mean sites using eZ Publish 5.x with a front end done with the new Web stack, Twig and Symfony based (and not the legacy system).</p><p>The graph below is taken from our bench, on the standard eZ Demo site. It shows the number of pages delivered by a simple small box running standard eZ Publish installations. With 5.2, we have roughly been multiplied by 4 since eZ Publish 4.7 - it speaks by itself.</p><p>You could see this as a way to divide by 4 your hardware infrastructure cost. More importantly, it says high-performance are getting more and more delivered out-of-the-box, without the need for extra layers and sophisticated tunings. This also saves costs.</p><p>This is something people should have in mind when evaluating whether to use Symfony “New Stack” or the legacy stack on new projects.</p>

</div><p>To add to this graph, while 450 pages per second on such a configuration is really not bad, it must be highlighted that it is only a benchmark on a standard out-of-the-box server. No clustering, no optimized configuration, no big muscle.</p><p>For more performance and clustering setups, Varnish Cache is the plugin replacement to go for. With the same unique tight integration between eZ Publish and the Varnish Cache as the default cache benchmarked above, you can get many thousand requests per second and beyond without sacrificing anything in terms of making sure your content is up to date online. In addition such a setup removes most of the load on your web servers, making it handle peaks in a much better way. We will try to share more on what can be expected when optimizing the stack in future blog posts to give a real idea of what can be achieved.</p><a name="eztoc390149_2" id="eztoc390149_2"></a><h2>Pure legacy stacks remains what it was, combining legacy and the new stack has some clear limitations that shall be known</h2><p>As I mentioned before, eZ Publish 5 is complex to understand, as it has a complex dual-kernel architecture. One should not necessarily read too quickly and make sure he understands in which configuration he is.</p><p>I will try to summarize simply, we can basically see 3 main ways to use eZ Publish 5:</p>
<ul>

<li>New Stack: using the new Symfony based architecture and Twig based templates.</li>

<li>Hybrid: using the legacy within the new stack, authorizing everything that was done in legacy, but going through the new kernel and the Symfony stack.</li>

<li>Pure legacy: using only the legacy part, as you would use eZ Publish 4.7.</li>

</ul>
<p>(note: there is also a “legacy mode” in the Hybrid approach that is <a href="http://share.ez.no/blogs/jerome-vieilledent/legacy_mode-clarified" title="legacy mode clarified blog" target="_blank">discussed here</a>&nbsp;and should not be confused with this “pure legacy” &nbsp;approach)</p><p>This other figure below shows the numbers we got for an eZ Flow page using both the hybrid approach combining Legacy &amp; New stack and the Pure legacy approach.</p>

Sharing some information, (honestly and not tweaked by marketeers) on these benchmarks is important to us and I hope it is useful to the people planning new projects. Our engineering team will surely provide much more detailed information on the topic, including the detail of the test protocols and other things. Feel free to anticipate and discuss it on the <a href="http://share.ez.no/forums" title="Share forums" target="_blank">share.ez.no </a><a href="http://share.ez.no/forums" id="__mce_tmp" title="Share forums" target="_blank">forums</a>.<br />What can be said for now is:</p>
<ul>

<li>You want your eZ Publish to fly? The new architecture will make this happen, and we can thank the cache approach provided by Symfony2 framework for this, further extended in eZ Publish to integrate it tightly into the eZ Publish 5 Content repository and it's advance capabilities. <b>If you want to build for High Performance, think New Stack &amp; Symfony!</b></li>

<li>If you are conservative, or a fan of our old templating engine, may be you should consider the “pure legacy” approach, you will not be surprised at all in regards to performances.</li>

<li>If you fall in between the two approach (may be because you have existing code to keep with you), you need to be careful, high-performance can be reached but they need extra tuning, potentially additional caching components and a smart design and code of your site.</li>

</ul>

      <p>Living in a rapidly changing and dynamic world, I believe sustainability is the ability to reinvent oneselves. Taking the best from the past, let go of the rest, and then add what is new and promising.</p><p>eZ has always been innovative. From being one of the first companies with a commercial open source business model, to launching eZ Publish 3 in 2003, redefining content management with the uniquely customizable content engine and moving into customer experience management in 2011.</p><a name="eztoc389855_1" id="eztoc389855_1"></a><h2>Question is what is the future direction of eZ?</h2><p>Our ambitions are clear; We are a player in the rapidly growing Content Management &amp; Customer Experience markets. It is however not only about being a player, we will diverge from the crowds, define our unique space in this market and grow this space as a market leader.</p><p>We started this process by analysing our target customers and what value we can provide to them today and in their rapidly dynamic world.</p><p>As a provider of a very versatile and flexible open source content management platform, we have customers in over 160 countries, in most verticals, ranging from some of the largest global enterprises down to small businesses. Our platform has successfully brought horizontal solutions to a diversity of business challenges, amongst them multiple online properties management, localized content, high volume of content, integrated business processes (ex: e-commerce workflows) and generally: complexity management, transferred from the organization to the content platform. While this shows the power of eZ Publish, we want to be more focused to create more value to our targeted customers, building on these identified strengths.</p><p>We have defined 3 key customer attributes, defining our focused customer profiles:</p><p><i><b>Target Customer attribute # 1: We will focus on the Business Owner</b></i></p><p>eZ shall be there to solve a business need, where it in the end all comes back to one of two things; either drive more revenue or save costs.</p><p><i><b>Target Customer attribute # 2: We will focus on large enterprises and organizations</b></i></p><p>eZ shall focus on proving the best solutions solving the business needs of enterprise and upper mid market businesses and organizations.</p><p><i><b>Target Customer attribute # 3: We will focus on verticals where content is a value driver in digitizing business models</b></i></p><p>eZ shall focus on creating business value for customers in verticals like Media, Finance and Public sector and other verticals where content is a key driver of their future digital success.</p><p>I will soon continue in 3 follow-up blog posts, in more details, in the coming month and we will start revealing our exciting new product portfolio and roadmap with the upcoming eZ Publish 5.2 release end of November.</p><p>The next blog posts:</p>

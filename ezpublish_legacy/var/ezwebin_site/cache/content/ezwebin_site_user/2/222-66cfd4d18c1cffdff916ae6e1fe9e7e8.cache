      <a name="eztoc393865_1" id="eztoc393865_1"></a><h2>Why Should I Automate Marketing?</h2><p>You can certainly say that implementing marketing automation, shaping your marketing strategy into it, takes a little additional effort (time &amp; budget). The main element of ROI (Return On Investment) is a more satisfying customer journey for your visitors, on your website and other digital touch-points (tailored emails, pre-filled forms, etc).</p><p>Is that it, automation? Nope, not only. It’s a way to create, understand and address different segments within your contact/visitors base in order to talk to them individually, with an adapted and personalized speech, in an automated way. So, a first step would be to segment.</p><a name="eztoc393865_2" id="eztoc393865_2"></a><h2>Divide and Rule? No, Segment and Personalize</h2><p>First of all, what is a segment? It is a group of people/profiles with one or many common characteristics. Segmenting means you will create different customer/visitor profiles and find out what they are interested in within your products, what they are expecting from you.</p><p>You create segmentation within your potential customers (prospects) profiles. Of course, it requires having an idea of who your prospects and customers are, their needs and in a more “expert mode”, their wishes and expectations. In other words, such profiles are derived from your definition of your target market(s). They are sometimes called “persona”.</p><p>And once your profiles’ definitions are all set (by the way, they must adapt as your strategy evolves!), you will be able to personalize the information and the offers you are sending them. You will be able to create a tailored exchange. (<i>We probably all have experienced this situation:&nbsp; you receive an email with the exact information you were looking for. Is it magic? No, it is segmentation!</i>).</p><p>I can hear some of you saying that segmentation will just divide our valuable contact base into small groups. No, because with marketing automation, segments are a dynamic concept. This means that, according to the journey a visitor takes on your website and touch-points, she will possibly belong to more than one segment. So, on the opposite, the more your visitor navigates on your website, the more refined his profile will be, the better you know him… and this is all automatic and dynamic!&nbsp;</p><a name="eztoc393865_3" id="eztoc393865_3"></a><h2>What About Segments in eZ Marketing Automation?</h2><p>As marketing automation is based on segmentation, there is quite logically a tab called “Segment” in eZ Publish Platform’s core extension “<a href="http://ez.no/Products/Digital-Marketing-Customer-Experience/Marketing-Automation" target="_self"><b>eZ Marketing Automation</b></a>”. In this tab, you can create a segment for which you define all srts of characteristics (conditions):</p>

	</div>
			</div>
</div>
</div><p>Every visitor that will fulfill these conditions will become a member of this segment</p><p>Let’s take a very basic use-case:</p><p>You are a reseller of a product and your product is built for 3 sizes of business (small, medium, large). And your product is also available in French, English and German. You can create a segment that is called “Small French Companies”. In your segment, you establish that the visitors staying, for instance, more than 5 minutes on the product description page for small companies and coming from France will belong to this segment.</p><a name="eztoc393865_4" id="eztoc393865_4"></a><h2>Now What? What Should I Do With my Segments?</h2><p>Two weeks later, you are launching a brand new feature on the French product for small companies. Now, well equipped with your segments, you can address only the small French companies and tell them: “Hey, you might be interested in this new feature!”.</p><p>This is of course an extremely basic example. Thanks to <a href="http://ez.no/Products/Digital-Marketing-Customer-Experience/Marketing-Automation" target="_self">eZ Marketing Automation</a> you will be able to segment according to activities on the website, to the fact they filled out a form (and which one), on how they reacted to one of your marketing email campaign, on how they reached your website, and many other behavioral parameters (activity, engagement).</p><p>Segmentation is only one aspect of marketing automation. There are many more interesting features that can help you to improve your customers’ and prospects’ experience (to name a few: prospect tracking, advanced lead nurturing, <a href="http://ez.no/About-eZ/Blog/How-To-Capture-Leads-With-eZ-Publish-Platform" target="_self">landing pages &amp; forms</a>.</p><p>This can seem a bit complicated at first, and can come through more easily with a live and personalized demo. Feel free to request one from one of our eZ Consultants on Marketing Automation.</p>

But these visitors are potential customers. If you want to contact them, you have to retrieve some information about them. One of the principles to achieve this is to create landing pages with forms. The interested visitors, who expect value from your content, will intentionally fill out these forms. This is the idea behind <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inbound_marketing" target="_blank">Inbound Marketing or Permission Marketing</a>. You will be able to nurture your contact database and your funnel. The lead capture is the first step of Customer Relationship Management (CRM).</p><p>This harvested information, throughout the visitors' navigation, will help your teams (marketing, sales,...) better know the leads in order to increase the amount of sales opportunities.</p><a name="eztoc393523_2" id="eztoc393523_2"></a><h2>2 - The Solution? eZ Marketing Automation!</h2><p>The eZ Marketing Automation extension has a great feature that eases the process of creating the forms for the landing pages. You do not need programming of technical skills: you can simply drag and drop fields, and define the required ones. Straight-forward!</p>
<div class=""><img src="http://ez.no/var/ezflow_site/storage/images/media/images/blog/ez-marketing-automation-form-builder/393571-1-eng-GB/eZ-Marketing-Automation-Form-Builder.jpg" alt="eZ Marketing Automation Form Builder" /></div><p>Once you have created the form, the final step is to define the so-called &quot;form actions&quot;: send notifications, CRM synchronization, list membership modification, segmenting...</p>

<div class=""><img src="http://ez.no/var/ezflow_site/storage/images/media/images/blog/mockup-landing-page-form/393579-1-eng-GB/Mockup-Landing-Page-Form.png" alt="Mockup Landing Page Form" /></div><p>We implemented this new design on 6 different landing pages. Our best result? An increase of <b>66%</b> in form conversion.</p><p>Since the release of eZ Publish 5.2, all of our landing pages are using this new design, which still include eZ Marketing Automation forms.</p><a name="eztoc393523_4" id="eztoc393523_4"></a><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Integrating web forms generate leads and grow demand generation is nowadays required in digital marketing. Your pieces of content with high added-value (whitepapers, brochures, presentations, special offers,...) should be placed behind a formwall, embedded in a landing page. eZ Publish Platform and eZ Marketing Automation facilitate the setup of lead-generation forms.</p><p><b>Don’t miss any prospect anymore, don’t miss any sale opportunity anymore.</b></p>

      <p>What else is key to helping owners of larger businesses and organizations succeed - especially those with high volume and frequency of content and use?</p><p>My brother, with whom I co-founded eZ, and I come from a family of generations of retailers. I remember very well my father telling me that the Customer is King, and that the key to selling is to make sure their buying experience, from the moment they walk into the store, is as satisfactory as possible. We are not only selling a product, he said, but an experience.</p><p>Which is true. And, like any good retailer, he has learned how to make sure the customers get the right positive buying experience.</p><p>He has tens of, up to a few hundred, customers each day, meeting them face to face. However, in the fast-moving digital world, you are exposed to thousands or millions of potential customers. How, then, can we ensure that we optimize the customer experience to maximize sales conversion?</p><p>The answer lies in Big/Smart Data - how we can use advanced tracking systems and algorithms to allow you to analyse and learn your customers’ preferences. Because any great customer experience starts with knowing your customers.</p><p>Great customer experiences in the digital world start with Big Data: making sure you provide the right information to the right person, at the right time, using the right channel.</p><p>Since 2011, eZ has been providing solutions for exactly this; analytics, personalization, recommendation and automation. Especially powerful is the combination of content and Big Data tools for customer experience, as you can get the most both out of your content as well as your customer experience.</p><p>I already specified<a href="http://ez.no/About-eZ/Blog/Content-Is-Gold" target="_self">&nbsp;in my last blog post</a> that for eZ’s future product strategy, Content is Gold. Well, the Customer is King, and with that in mind we will ensure that our powerful content platform is ready for Big Data and integrated with our best-of-breed customer experience solutions.</p>

New customer habits combined with new players make traditional business methods more challenging, while simultaneously creating huge opportunities for those who recognize and embrace them. Retail, travel and financial services are examples of the industries affected.</p><p>Thus, I believe that in the digital economy of the future, every company in any vertical is a publisher and needs to think like a media company - and content is the key driver of their success.</p><a name="eztoc391251_1" id="eztoc391251_1"></a><h2>Why?</h2><p>With changing customer habits, the buying process is moving into the digital realm. The right content about your product or services, from the right source, available through the right channel, is key to obtaining a buying decision.</p><p>So what can we learn from the media industry? For any successful digital business, you need to ensure:</p><p>#1:&nbsp;That you can involve any person, within your company or outside, in your publishing process in a simple, social, but controlled way.</p><div class="separator"><span></span></div><p>#2:&nbsp;That you can utilize the power of all types of content - be it text, film or pictures - from any source, such as your ERP, Document Management or CRM.</p><div class="separator"><span></span></div><p>#3:&nbsp;That you can publish your content in any of today’s channels - mobile, web, print, tablet, social - and more importantly, the channels of the future.</p><div class="separator"><span></span></div><p>
Content is Gold, and is the basis of any successful digital business model, today and in the future.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
At eZ we will not forget this, even while everybody runs after the next hyped trend. eZ will continue to focus on creating great content management software, making sure anyone can create any type of content and publish it in any channel - of today and in the future - and providing tools to optimize this content lifecycle.<br />
&nbsp;<br />Just as in your digital business, we treat Content as Gold, and create the tools to help new, fully digital and traditional businesses remain successful, for today and tomorrow.</p>

No clustering, no optimized configuration.</p><p>For more performance and clustering setups, Varnish Cache is the plugin replacement to go for. With the same unique tight integration between eZ Publish and the Varnish Cache as the default cache benchmarked above, you can get many thousand requests per second and beyond without sacrificing anything in terms of making sure your content is up to date online. In addition such a setup removes most of the load on your web servers, making it handle peaks in a much better way better.

One should not necessarily read too quickly on the goodness below.</p><p>I will try to summarize simply, we can basically see 3 main ways to use eZ Publish 5:</p>
<ul>

<li>New Stack: using the new Symfony based architecture and Twig based templates.</li>

<li>Hybrid: using the legacy within the new stack, authorizing everything that was done in legacy, but going through the new symfony stack.</li>

<li>Pure legacy: using only the legacy part, as you would use eZ Publish 4.7.</li>

</ul>
<p>
(note: there is also a “legacy mode” in the Hybrid approach that is <a href="http://share.ez.no/blogs/jerome-vieilledent/legacy_mode-clarified" title="legacy mode clarified blog" target="_blank">discussed here</a>&nbsp;and should not be confused &nbsp;with this “pure legacy” &nbsp;approach)<br />This other figure below shows the numbers we got for an eZ Flow page using both the hybrid approach combining Legacy &amp; New stack and the Pure legacy approach.</p>

Sharing some information, (honestly and not tweaked by marketeers) on these benchmarks is important to us and I hope it is useful to the people planning new projects. Our engineering team will surely provide much more detailed information on the topic, including the detail of the test protocols and other things. Feel free to anticipate and discuss it on the <a href="http://share.ez.no/forums" title="Share forums" target="_blank">share.ez.no </a><a href="http://share.ez.no/forums" id="__mce_tmp" title="Share forums" target="_blank">forums</a>.<br />What can be said for now is:</p>
<ul>

<li>You want your eZ Publish to fly? The new architecture will make this happen, and we can thank the cache approach provided by Symfony2 framework for this, further extended in eZ Publish to integrate it tightly into the eZ Publish 5 Content repository and it's advance capabilities. If you want to build for High Performance, think New Stack &amp; Symfony!</li>

<li>If you are conservative, or a fan of our old templating engine, may be you should consider the “pure legacy” approach, you will not be surprised at all in regards to performances.</li>

<li>If you fall in between the two approach (may be because you have existing code to keep with you), you need to be careful, high performances can be reached but they need extra tuning, potentially additional caching components and a smart design and code of your site.</li>

</ul>
<p>If you want to know more about what other goodness are in the 5.2 release, there will be more details very soon about the 5.2 Release Webinar.</p>

      <p>Living in a rapidly changing and dynamic world, I believe sustainability is the ability to reinvent oneselves. Taking the best from the past, let go of the rest, and then add what is new and promising.</p><p>eZ has always been innovative. From being one of the first companies with a commercial open source business model, to launching eZ Publish 3 in 2003, redefining content management with the uniquely customizable content engine and moving into customer experience management in 2011.</p><a name="eztoc389855_1" id="eztoc389855_1"></a><h2>Question is what is the future direction of eZ?</h2><p>Our ambitions are clear; We are a player in the rapidly growing Content Management &amp; Customer Experience markets. It is however not only about being a player, we will diverge from the crowds, define our unique space in this market and grow this space as a market leader.</p><p>We started this process by analysing our target customers and what value we can provide to them today and in their rapidly dynamic world.</p><p>As a provider of a very versatile and flexible open source content management platform, we have customers in over 160 countries, in most verticals, ranging from some of the largest global enterprises down to small businesses. Our platform has successfully brought horizontal solutions to a diversity of business challenges, amongst them multiple online properties management, localized content, high volume of content, integrated business processes (ex: e-commerce workflows) and generally: complexity management, transferred from the organization to the content platform. While this shows the power of eZ Publish, we want to be more focused to create more value to our targeted customers, building on these identified strengths.</p><p>We have defined 3 key customer attributes, defining our focused customer profiles:</p><p><i><b>Target Customer attribute # 1: We will focus on the Business Owner</b></i></p><p>eZ shall be there to solve a business need, where it in the end all comes back to one of two things; either drive more revenue or save costs.</p><p><i><b>Target Customer attribute # 2: We will focus on large enterprises and organizations</b></i></p><p>eZ shall focus on proving the best solutions solving the business needs of enterprise and upper mid market businesses and organizations.</p><p><i><b>Target Customer attribute # 3: We will focus on verticals where content is a value driver in digitizing business models</b></i></p><p>eZ shall focus on creating business value for customers in verticals like Media, Finance and Public sector and other verticals where content is a key driver of their future digital success.</p><p>I will soon continue in 3 follow-up blog posts, in more details, in the coming month and we will start revealing our exciting new product portfolio and roadmap with the upcoming eZ Publish 5.2 release end of November.</p><p>The next blog posts:</p>
<ul>

<li>#2: Content is Gold</li>

<li>#3: Big Data improving Customer Experience</li>

<li>#4: Where Content Means Business</li>

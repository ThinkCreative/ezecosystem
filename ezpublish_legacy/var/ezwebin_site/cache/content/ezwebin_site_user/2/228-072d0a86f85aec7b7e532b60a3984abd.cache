      <p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p>Since the last article on this blog was about <a href="http://www.netgen.hr/eng/Blog/Going-mobile-with-eZ-Publish" target="_blank">Going mobile with eZ Publish</a>, I’ll show you how to create a new siteaccess in eZ Publish with an intention of creating a mobile channel. And that’s actually one of the main reasons why eZ Publish is so versatile, since with multiple siteaccesses you can create a site that will cover all of your creative bases.</p><a name="eztoc6637_1" id="eztoc6637_1"></a><h2>Creating a new siteaccess in eZ Publish</h2><a name="eztoc6637_1_1" id="eztoc6637_1_1"></a><h3>What’s a siteaccess anyway?</h3><p>You have probably heard the word siteaccess in the context of eZ Publish programming a lot of times already. But did you stop and consider what this concept actually means? Well, to put it as simple as possible, a siteaccess is a way to handle multiple sites on a single installation of eZ Publish. From a technical standpoint, a siteaccess is just a bunch of INI settings which you set up and then apply necessary changes for these multiple sites. Now, when I say “multiple sites”, you probably think of different content for each site, different design and whatnot. And yes, while you may do stuff like that on a single installation, too, a siteaccess runs deeper than that.</p><p>You see, you handle siteaccesses in your day-to-day operations in eZ Publish already! How can this be? Well, for example, the Administration Interface, the place where all of your content comes together, is a siteaccess. If you have a multilingual site, you are using multiple siteaccesses, each siteaccess representing a language in your installation. It’s just a matter of a common design between all of them which defines the whole look-and-feel throughout your siteaccesses.</p><p>You can even go so far as to create different channels for different types of users. For example, if you have a news portal, and you have a group of users called Journalists, you can create a siteaccess for them which will serve as an editorial interface, but will be adjusted to their particular needs, which is writing articles and putting them in the right context (topic-based). Also, you can create another group of users called, for example, Photographers, and limit them only to the upload of images and editing existing articles so they can fill them up with images, etc.</p><p>Siteaccesses provide us with a possibility to create specialized portions of a site which serves a certain need. In a similar manner, a mobile site based on a large corporate site which was created in eZ Publish serves a certain need, which is delivering content created for the mobile version of our site.</p><p>Siteaccesses come in handy in all of those situations because they are relatively easy to set up and all you have to do then is apply whatever changes you need to them, e.g., a new design, a new order in which the content is output, or just a new language.</p><p>You can even go so far to link each siteaccess to different subdomains of your site so you can have, for example, your main siteaccess in, say, English, www.example.com, your Administration Interface, admin.example.com, your mobile site, mobile.example.com, and, say, the portion of the site in French, french.example.com. And then, after all that, you can create a completely new siteaccess linked to another domain called, e.g., new.example.com, which will actually output a whole different content in a whole new surrounding.</p><p>As far as accessing the website is concerned, eZ Publish has three most commonly used distinct methods of choosing the siteaccess: through the URI, through the host, and through the port. There is a fourth one, servervar, but it is rarely used. The URI is the default and the easiest way to set up your siteaccess. Since the URI is just a part of the URL, all you need to do is add the name of your siteaccess to the main URL (for example: www.example.com/name_of_siteaccess), and the siteaccess matching the URI part will be displayed. Using the host access method is a bit trickier, because you need to set up a subdomain (or subdomains), and the Virtual Host mode on your server. Then you will get the type of example we mentioned earlier (name.example.com). The port access method is linking the various siteaccesses to the ports on your server, so, for example, you can link your main siteaccess to port 80, and the administration siteaccess to port 81. You can even go so far as to combine the URI and host access methods, so that they can both be available to the end-user.</p><p>As you can see, a siteaccess is actually a very versatile tool which makes your daily eZ Publish programming a lot easier to manipulate, and in the end, makes your clients more satisfied because the siteaccess system shortens the time necessary to apply multiple solutions to one installation.</p><a name="eztoc6637_1_2" id="eztoc6637_1_2"></a><h3>How to create a siteaccess</h3><p>All of the siteaccesses on a site are created in the <b>settings</b> folder of our eZ Publish installation. As you probably can tell just by the look of it, the settings folder has a number of INI files, and two folders in it, <b>siteaccess</b> and <b>override</b>. Now, all of your siteaccess-particular settings are located in the <b>siteaccess</b> folder, and all of the settings regarding the whole eZ installation are located in the <b>override</b> folder.</p><p>To create a new siteaccess, go to the <b>mypage/settings/siteaccess</b> folder of your eZ Publish installation and create a new folder here called <b>mobile</b>. We will call it <b>mobile</b> under the assumption that the new channel will handle all of the mobile content for our site.</p><p>The next step is actually telling eZ Publish that we want this mobile folder to be a new siteaccess. For that purpose, we need to set up some settings in the <b>site.ini</b> file. So, go to the <b>/settings/override</b> folder of your installation and open the <b>site.ini.append.php</b> file. In it, you have the relevant settings for your whole site. We are interested in the SiteAccessSettings block. Edit the SiteAccessSettings block of the <b>site.ini.append.php</b> file like so:</p><pre>[SiteAccessSettings]
AvailableSiteAccessList[]=mobile</pre><p>Just to be clear, don’t delete anthing else you might have under this block, just add this new line so you can prepare your installation for a new siteaccess.</p><p>After that, we need some new site settings for the mobile channel. The best way to set up our new siteaccess to use every resource the rest of the siteaccesses use is to copy a <b>site.ini.append.php</b> file from another siteaccess, for example, the most common one, <b>eng</b>. So, we’ll do just that. Go into <b>/settings/siteaccess/eng</b>, copy the <b>site.ini.append.php</b> file and paste it into the <b>/settings/siteaccess/mobile</b> folder. After that, open the new <b>site.ini.append.php</b> file and make the necessary modifications like so:</p><pre>[SiteAccessSettings]
RequireUserLogin=false
RelatedSiteAccessList[]=eng
RelatedSiteAccessList[]=administration
MatchOrder=uri;host
HostMatchMapItems[]
HostMatchMapItems[]=mobile.mypage.com;mobile
[DesignSettings]
SiteDesign=mobile
AdditionalSiteDesignList[]=mydesign
AdditionalSiteDesignList[]=ezwebin
AdditionalSiteDesignList[]=base</pre><p>So, what do we have here? Under the SiteAccessSettings block, we have told eZ Publish that a user doesn’t need a username or password to open the mobile channel. Also, content-wise, we have told eZ Publish that <b>eng</b> and <b>administration</b> will be the related siteaccesses which means that their view cache will be cleared when it is cleared for the current siteaccess. Also, we set up the <b>mobile</b> siteaccess so that it will open if the user inputs two possible addresses in the address bar (mobile.mypage.com or mypage.com/mobile). Of course, that’s assuming that the Virtual Host is set up properly. After that, I have assumed that a mobile channel needs to have a new design, therefore, we have set up a new design called <b>mobile</b> which this siteaccess will use. But, no worries, since it will fall back on the list of designs we already use all over the site if eZ Publish doesn’t find the <b>mobile</b> design.</p><p>Even though we’ve set up almost everything needed in regards to this siteaccess, there is still a few things we need to do. For example, with these settings we have created a new siteaccess, but it still won’t be visible in the Quick Settings of the Administration Interface. To make it visible, we need to do one last thing in regards to the INI settings. Go into <b>/settings/siteaccess/administration</b> and put your new siteaccess on the RelatedSiteAccess list in the <b>site.ini.append.php</b> here, too. After that, access your Administration Interface through the browser, and clear the INI cache in the Global (override) siteaccess. After that, your new siteaccess will be visible in your Administration.</p>

<p>Mobile siteaccess visible among other siteaccesses</p> </div>
         </div>
</div>
</div><p>But, wait! We need to do one more thing. Currently, the way we set up our new siteaccess, no Anonymous User will be able to access it. Why is that? Well, the RequireUserLogin works as a global switch to determine if a user needs to supply credentials to gain entry into a siteaccess. But that doesn’t mean that Anonymous Users really have access to the mobile channel. That’s what Roles and Policies are for. You see, eZ Publish checks two things: does a user need to supply credentials to enter a siteaccess (RequireUserLogin), and can a user truly enter the siteaccess (Roles and Policies). If one of those isn’t set up properly, Anonymous Users won’t be able to view our mobile site. Which is why we need to grant them this privilege. Let’s do that, shall we?</p><p>Go to the User Accounts tab in the Administration Interface and click on Roles And Policies. Click on the Anonymous role, and click on Edit. After that, add a new policy. In the Wizard, under Module, click on user, under Function, click on login, and then click on Grant limited access. After that, you’ll get a list of all the siteaccesses of the site. Choose mobile, and click on OK. after that, click on Save.</p><p>Now, try to access your site. If you have set up your site locally go to: mypage/mobile, and see if it outputs any errors. If it doesn’t, you have set up your siteaccess, and if it does, go through all of the previously described steps and see if you’ve set everything up properly.</p><p>To sum up, setting up a new siteaccess means simply setting up new INI settings and clearing the cache. eZ Publish does everything else for you. And that is the beauty of the siteaccess system. You don’t need to do much to set it up, but it represents, as Igor wrote in the previous article, such a simple way to setup radically different user experiences that can provide you with new possibilities: a new design, a new language, some custom settings, or even a whole new content (a new database and storage). The siteaccess engine is powerful and easy, and that’s what makes it a good practice.</p><p>
Until next time, I wish you happy coding,<br />Tomislav</p>

Under the SiteAccessSettings block, we have told eZ Publish that a user doesn’t need a username or password to open the mobile channel. Also, content-wise, we have told eZ Publish that <b>eng</b> and <b>administration</b> will be the related siteaccesses which means that their view cache will be cleared when it is cleared for the current siteaccess. Also, we set up the <b>mobile</b> siteaccess so that it will open if the user inputs two possible addresses in the address bar (mobile.mypage.com or mypage.com/mobile). Of course, that’s assuming that the Virtual Host is set up properly. After that, I have assumed that a mobile channel needs to have a new design, therefore, we have set up a new design called <b>mobile</b> which this siteaccess will use. But, no worries, since it will fall back on the list of designs we already use all over the site if eZ Publish doesn’t find the <b>mobile</b> design.</p><p>Even though we’ve set up almost everything needed in regards to this siteaccess, there is still a few things we need to do. For example, with these settings we have created a new siteaccess, but it still won’t be visible in the Quick Settings of the Administration Interface. To make it visible, we need to do one last thing in regards to the INI settings. Go into <b>/settings/siteaccess/administration</b> and put your new siteaccess on the RelatedSiteAccess list in the <b>site.ini.append.php</b> here, too. After that, access your Administration Interface through the browser, and clear the INI cache in the Global (override) siteaccess. After that, your new siteaccess will be visible in your Administration.</p>

</div><p>But, wait! We need to do one more thing. Currently, the way we set up our new siteaccess, no Anonymous User will be able to access it. Why is that? Well, the RequireUserLogin works as a global switch to determine if a user needs to supply credentials to gain entry into a siteaccess. But that doesn’t mean that Anonymous Users really have access to the mobile channel. That’s what Roles and Policies are for. You see, eZ Publish checks two things: does a user need to supply credentials to enter a siteaccess (RequireUserLogin), and can a user truly enter the siteaccess (Roles and Policies). If one of those isn’t set up properly, Anonymous Users won’t be able to view our mobile site. Which is why we need to grant them this privilege. Let’s do that, shall we?</p><p>Go to the User Accounts tab in the Administration Interface and click on Roles And Policies. Click on the Anonymous role, and click on Edit. After that, add a new policy. In the Wizard, under Module, click on user, under Function, click on login, and then click on Grant limited access. After that, you’ll get a list of all the siteaccesses of the site. Choose mobile, and click on OK. after that, click on Save.</p><p>Now, try to access your site. If you have set up your site locally go to: mypage/mobile, and see if it outputs any errors. If it doesn’t, you have set up your siteaccess, and if it does, go through all of the previously described steps and see if you’ve set everything up properly.</p><p>To sum up, setting up a new siteaccess means simply setting up new INI settings and clearing the cache. eZ Publish does everything else for you. And that is the beauty of the siteaccess system. You don’t need to do much to set it up, but it represents, as Igor wrote in the previous article, such a simple way to setup radically different user experiences that can provide you with new possibilities: a new design, a new language, some custom settings, or even a whole new content (a new database and storage). The siteaccess engine is powerful and easy, and that’s what makes it a good practice.</p><p>

      <p>These days, mobile seems to be the mother of all buzzwords in the web development community. The blogosphere is bursting with advices on the best mobile strategy, design community battles with evergrowing number of different devices that are accessing web pages and more and more media creators are pushing their content through different channels and devices. And I think that this buzz is here for a good reason.</p><p>You can trust the reports such as <a href="http://mashable.com/2010/04/13/mobile-web-stats/" target="_self">the Morgan Stanley report (more than a year old)</a>, or you can just take a look around you while sitting in any coffee house, bar or hotel lobby and see the growing number of people staring at the screens of their mobile devices. Mobile web / Internet usage has gained enormous momentum in the last few years and has pushed itself into becoming one of the mainstream ways of consuming the online content.</p><p>In the eZ Publish community, we need to keep up the pace with these changes, and provide our clients with the right solutions for this brave new and mobile world we are living in. I believe we have all the tools needed.</p><p>The main features of eZ Publish that enable us to develop different kinds of mobile solutions are:</p>
<ul>

<li>clean separation of design and content</li>

<li>flexible content model that we can leverage to model the data to our needs and</li>

<li>rich and well-defined APIs that we can use to access the CMS and integrate it with external systems.</li>

</ul>
<p>By utilizing these features eZ Publish developers can choose one or more different approaches for enabling mobile access to the content stored in the CMS.</p><a name="eztoc6608_1" id="eztoc6608_1"></a><h2>Mobile approach no.1: responsive web pages</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/" target="_blank">Boston Globe website</a> is one of sucessful implementations of responsive web design</p> </div>
         </div>
</div>
</div><p>One of the currently most cited and discussed approaches to solving the mobile problem originated with <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/" target="_self">the excellent A List Apart article by Ethan Marcotte</a>. The author argues that in today’s world of almost chaotic change in number and types of devices accessing the web pages it is not enough to limit our approach to desktop (or better said, big screen devices with horizontal resolution usually greater than 1000 px) and standard mobile phone device (small screens with 480 x 320 px&nbsp; or similar resolution). The solution proposed by the author is a combination of fluid grids, flexible images and CSS3 media queries that enable the designer to build layouts that use the same HTML content, but in a dynamic manner so that the web page adapts itself to any device resolution. This “one content to rule them all” solution relies on HTML / CSS client side code and is, in general, agnostic to server side technologies used. eZ Publish, with its clean separation of content and presentation, excels in providing the front side developer with just that kind of clean markup. Just remember not to use fixed pixel sizing in your content and templates!</p><a name="eztoc6608_2" id="eztoc6608_2"></a><h2>Mobile approach no.2: dedicated mobile web sites</h2><p>Contrasting the responsive web pages approach, we have the solution where a “specialized” mobile site is created for the small screen devices. Usually, some kind of device or feature detection is used on the server or the client side and a client accessing the site is redirected to the appropriate version, the mobile one often being set up with a different hostname on the same domain or URL suffix (www.example.com/mobile or m.example.com). Although not as popular nowadays as the responsive solution mentioned above (at least among top-notch web designers and developers, doubtfully if comparing the number of sites in production), we still believe that this solution has its place. The most important factor in choosing which approach to take is to consider the context in which the site will be commonly used. This reasoning has its flaws, as sometimes a user just wants to use the mobile device to access the same content while sitting in front of the TV, but one can argue that benefits of making a specialized site version for the mobile user can make it the right thing to do.</p>

<p>Search results based on distance</p> </div>
         </div>
</div>
</div><p>For example, one of the sites we developed, which is also one of the largest Croatian yellow pages sites, provides radically different experiences when accessed by desktop or mobile device. When a desktop client accesses the site, a rich user experience is provided, which augments content about the businesses in the catalog with additional information such as user-generated data (user comments, rating), image galleries etc. Contrasting this, when a mobile device accesses the same site, the focus is much more on the content and data regarding the business, avoiding all the unnecessary information that could degrade usability&nbsp; when presented on a small screen and possibly using higher-latency, lower bandwidth Internet connections. Additionally, geolocation capabilities, that are available<a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=geolocation" target="_self">&nbsp;in most of the current mobile browsers</a>, are used to enable simple spatial features such as providing the user a way to quickly find the nearest business (depending on his/hers position), providing routing information, etc.</p><p>On an eZ Publish installation, making a separate siteaccess for a mobile site is a trivial effort, and the only thing we need to do is to ensure that we provide the appropriate device / feature detection. Also, if you want to include geolocation features to your mobile (or desktop) solutions, <a href="http://www.netgen.hr/eng/Blog/Geo-search-with-eZ-Find-search-for-nearest-locations" target="_self">check out our previous post</a>.</p><p>In this post we presented two ways of creating mobile solutions built on eZ Publish, both based on standard web technologies such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Opposed to this is the approach which implies using the native mobile application (and not the mobile browser) to access the data stored in the CMS. As we will present in the following blog post, eZ Publish provides all the necessary tools needed in this case as well.</p>

      <p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p>In the last two articles we have covered the creation of a custom module and a custom view of that module. Based on this, you can really customize eZ Publish to your heart's desire. And that's basically the whole point of creating your own websites, isn't it? Now we will make a turn, and look at all the ways you can change layouts on a portion of your website.</p><a name="eztoc6566_1" id="eztoc6566_1"></a><h2>Creation of a custom page layout in eZ Publish</h2><a name="eztoc6566_1_1" id="eztoc6566_1_1"></a><h3>The need for an extra layout</h3><p>Sometimes there arises a need for the developer to create a new page layout inside an existing page for a client. It's almost always based on the need to create a different look and feel on a section of a page which is used for all kinds of purposes (mobile web, different section of a page, etc.). When I say a different look and feel, I'm referring to a radical change in the layout of a page. New header, body, elements, footer, the works. There are actually three ways to do that, and we will cover them all.</p><a name="eztoc6566_1_2" id="eztoc6566_1_2"></a><h3>Overriding a pagelayout template</h3><p>Looking back on<a href="http://www.netgen.hr/eng/Blog/eZ-Publish-CMS-persistent-variables" target="_blank">&nbsp;Ivo Lukač's post on persistent variables</a> a while ago, we can see that it's relatively easy to set them using the<b>&nbsp;ezpagedata_set()</b> operator built in ezwebin. Also, there is a <b>set-block</b> function which we can use to set a persistent variable if the <b>ezpagedata_set()</b> operator is not available. We will show you how to override a layout and define it's persistent variable key, where to put the overridden template, and how to activate it.</p><p>So, open your project, and go to the <b>settings/siteaccess</b> folder. In it, find your siteaccess, and open it, and when you do, you will see, among all of your INI files, one called <b>override.ini.append.php</b>. In this file, if you recall, you override the templates which already exist in your project with custom ones. When you open the file, input the following lines of code:</p><pre>[new_pagelayout]
Source=pagelayout.tpl
MatchFile=new_pagelayout.tpl
Subdir=templates
Match[persistent_variable]=new_pagelayout</pre><p>What did we do here? We created a new persistent variable key in the override.ini, and linked it to a template called <b>new_pagelayout.tpl</b>. Now, in order for the template to work, you need to create it. So, of course, go to your extension. Open the <b>mypage/design/mypage/override/templates/</b> folder and in it, create a file called&nbsp;<b>new_pagelayout.tpl</b>. Bear in mind that this layout has to be set up as your original layout in the extent that you define everything from scratch. If you need a reference, just go to the original layout in your extension (<b>mypage/design/mypage/templates/pagelayout.tpl</b>), and look at how it is set up. After that, clear the INI and override caches and just put whatever elements you'd like in your new layout.</p><p>To determine what templates will use this new layout, enter the following lines at the beginning of your template to set up your persistent variable like so:</p><pre>{ezpagedata_set('new_pagelayout', true())}</pre><p>or:</p><pre>{set scope=global persistent_variable=hash('new_pagelayout', true())}</pre><p>if the <b>ezpagedata_set()</b> operator is not available to you.</p><p>Then you can look at the object using the layout to see your results. It's important to notice that only the view view of the content module is able to set persistent variables in such a manner.</p><p>When you use a persistent variable, you decide which templates are going to use the overridden layout. The same applies to usage with nodes, classes, etc. Which means that, for example, you can create a class (let’s call it custom_class for the purposes of this article), and just use it in your <b>override.ini</b> like so:</p><pre>[new_pagelayout]
Source=pagelayout.tpl
MatchFile=new_pagelayout.tpl
Subdir=templates
Match[class_identifier]=custom_class</pre><p>Now, the <b>new_pagelayout.tpl</b> will be used on every object of the class you’ve defined for this purpose.</p><p>Of course, the overriding doesn’t stop at classes because you can use a big list of override conditions for your new layout. You can find the whole reference fore the override conditions <a href="http://doc.ez.no/eZ-Publish/Technical-manual/4.x/Reference/Template-override-conditions" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p>After you clear all caches and display an object of your custom class, you will see that the <b>new_pagelayout.tpl</b> will be used! Isn’t that neat? In addition, there is no big hassle in creating new sub-domains, instances of eZ Publish, and whatnot. The stuff just works and that’s the most important thing.</p><p>Also, it’s important to notice that overriding a pagelayout template is only possible with the override rules applicable in the <b>content</b> module. Other modules (e.g. user/login) are unable to apply this type of change to their layouts. On the other hand, no unnecessary strings need to be added to the URL. So I would recommend this method only if you need to change the look and feel of the <b>content</b> module.</p><a name="eztoc6566_1_3" id="eztoc6566_1_3"></a><h3>Setting up a new layout template using the <b>layout</b> module</h3><p>Another way of setting up a new layout for a page is through the <b>layout</b> module. This is a more universal way than the one previously described, because it will work for all of the modules, but you need to have an extra part in the URL.</p><p>If you have examined all of the INI files in your eZ Publish project, you may have noticed that there is a<b>&nbsp;layout.ini</b> file. This file defines all of the different layouts you can use at a given portion of your site. And when you want to use the layout you define in this INI file, you just need to enter the following lines in your address bar:<b>&nbsp;/layout/set/new_pagelayout/url_of_the_node</b>. This gives an order to eZ Publish to use a new layout instead of the default one.</p><p>To set up your layout in the INI, go to your extension. In the <b>mypage/settings</b> folder, create a new PHP file called<b>&nbsp;layout.ini.append.php</b> and put the following settings in it:</p><pre><?php /* #?ini charset="utf-8"?
[new_pagelayout]
PageLayout=new_pagelayout.tpl
*/ ?></pre><p>As you can see, we have set up an alias for our layout in the square brackets and determined that when you type '<b>/layout/set/new_pagelayout</b>', eZ Publish overrides the default pagelayout and uses everything in the template you've accessed in a new layout.</p><p>After you set up your INI, put the <b>new_pagelayout.tpl</b> in the <b>mypage/design/mypage/templates</b> folder and clear all caches. If you then try to access your object in the previously described manner, you will see that your new layout is set up correctly.</p><a name="eztoc6566_1_4" id="eztoc6566_1_4"></a><h3>Setting up a new layout using a new module</h3><p>If you remember, in the article before last we have shown you how to create a new module. This is actually a quick, surefire way to set up a new layout using a module. And it is useful only in the cases when the previous two ways we’ve described are not enough, because you can make custom PHP additions and changes.</p><p>Let's say, for example, that you have created a new module called '<b>get</b>'. In it, you have created a view called '<b>layout</b>'. Now, in the<b>&nbsp;layout.php</b> file in your module, just put following lines of code:</p><pre><?php
$tpl = eZTemplate::factory();
$data = new eZPageData();
$data->modify($tpl, 'ezpagedata', null, null, null, $pagedata);
$tpl->setVariable( 'pagedata', $pagedata );
$tpl->setVariable( 'pagestyle', $pagedata['css_classes'] );
$tpl->setVariable( 'pagedesign', $pagedata['template_look'] );
$tpl->setVariable( 'current_node_id', $pagedata['node_id'] );
$tpl->setVariable( "access_type", $GLOBALS['eZCurrentAccess'] );
$pagelayoutResult = $tpl->fetch( 'design:new_pagelayout.tpl' );
echo( $pagelayoutResult );
eZExecution::cleanExit();
?></pre><p>So, in here we have set up an instance of our template, and set the persistent variables for the view, also, we have set up the CSS files we are going to use, as well as the node id we wish to set for our pagedata. After everything is set up, we fetch our page layout and use it in the view. To access this view, you need to type in the address bar the following: '<b>/get/layout/</b>', and there you have it, a new layout for your page!</p><p>As you can see, setting up a new page layout is really not that big of a deal once you get the hang of it, and this newfound knowledge can really help you in your future projects.</p><p>Until next time, I wish you happy coding,</p><p>Tomislav</p>

      <p>So once a year CEO-s of a big companies write a letter to their shareholders with year summary and the direction where the company is heading the next year, but as we are not a corporation (yet) I'll just write a simple blog post with just one business fact. The most important one.</p><a name="eztoc6548_0_1" id="eztoc6548_0_1"></a><h3>2011 summary</h3><p>Running a business requires lot of different skills and one of them is the ability to always "keep your eye on the ball". But once in a while you need to look at the big picture, to check if you achieved your goals or not, where are you heading, etc. One opportunity for a clean look is the financial year closure and in Croatia this is always in line with the calendar year end. Which is good as you can think about the whole thing during holidays :).</p><p>Was year 2011 successful for business? The rough estimates show that we achieved more than 60% cash flow growth with just 12% more man power (comparing to 2010). Enough said. It is hard to pin point exactly the reason for such a growth but here are few good guesses:</p>
<ul>

<li>getting more and more stronger in our niche (<a href="http://ez.no" target="_self">eZ Publish CMS</a>) by doing more complicated projects, gaining experience and expertize</li>

<li>a lot more external engagement and building credibility: writing blog posts, <a href="http://share.ez.no" target="_self">share.ez.no</a> activity, using social tools (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/netgentweets" target="_self">twitter</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/b/117089428399193516011/" target="_self">google+</a>)</li>

<li>being present on events like<a href="http://www.netgen.hr/eng/Blog/eZ-Winter-Conference-2011-in-Nice-Summary" target="_self">&nbsp;eZ Publish Winter Conference in Nice</a> and <a href="http://www.netgen.hr/eng/Blog/eZ-Conference-2011-in-London-a-Late-Recap" target="_self">eZ Publish Summer Conference in London</a></li>

<li>50% of the cash flow was export</li>

<li>we organized <a href="http://www.netgen.hr/eng/Blog/A-meeting-of-Croatian-eZ-Publish-developers-in-a-pub-Summary" target="_self">the first eZ Publish Croatia meetup</a>&nbsp;(just thinking on how to repeat that this year)</li>

<li>we are now covering 3 biggest theaters in Croatia with our&nbsp;<a href="http://www.netgen.hr/eng/Theatron" target="_self">box office solution</a>, web site and web shop&nbsp;</li>

<li>in March we co-founded the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.exportboomers.com/" target="_blank">Croatian Independent Software Exporters</a>&nbsp;association. The association currently has 85 members, really impressive.</li>

<li>started interviewing some eZ people on our blog (next interview coming soon)</li>

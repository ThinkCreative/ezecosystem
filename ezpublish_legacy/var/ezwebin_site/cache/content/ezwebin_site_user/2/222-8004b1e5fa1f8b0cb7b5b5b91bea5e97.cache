      <p>We’re still at the dawn of Marketing Automation and<a href="http://www.softwareadvice.com/crm/buyerview/marketing-automation-2014/" title="Software Advice" target="_blank">&nbsp;according to a recent research from Software Advice</a> (a marketing automation software evaluation company), many companies are still evaluating the tool and the opportunities and improvements it could offer them in their daily tasks. The key findings in the report on marketing automation buyer trends have established that 79% of the companies are using a marketing software (CRM, email marketing, industry-specific) but only 9% uses a marketing automation tool. But of course, those marketing software systems don’t offer the same range of features than in marketing automation tools.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class="">

The Orkla group is made up of about 100 companies located all over the world. Their organizational structure is complex and editors often change jobs within the organization, moving between companies and brands or products.</p><p>The essence is sharing how they have created a multisite and governance framework where Orkla can ensure their future growth in digital presence. This is essential to them. Their goal was to establish and maintain a common high quality platform, in which new sites can be launched continuously. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

It’s an inline editor based on the style of Barley to ease the publishing process. We want potential big customers to recognize the flexibility of the platform. We have based our framework on ez flow and common content types which allow us to launch new sites quicky. Each site reuse components that handle common functionality but it still allows for unique visual presentations.</p><a name="eztoc407425_3" id="eztoc407425_3"></a><h2>Why did MakingWaves decide to be a sponsor at this event?</h2><p>It is natural for us. We have a very strong team that has built solutions on eZ Publish for a long time. Many of our consultants hold the open source background dear. We are passionate about the product, and it is a very good fit for many of our clients. Our main office is also in Oslo, so it’s really cool to be present.&nbsp;</p><div class="align-center"><div class="download-button button button-link button-link-text  align-center ">

      <p>At a glance, eZ Publish Platform 5.3 brings the following key benefits:</p>
<ul>

<li>A Long Term Supported release,</li>

<li>Making it easier for developers to understand and learn,</li>

<li>Making it easier for developers to develop and deploy,</li>

<li>Updated Demo site with more ready-to-use features like Places.</li>

</ul>
<p>With more Symfony in it and less dependencies on the legacy stack, the main way to go is to use the new platform and the Symfony Framework when building content-based applications. It also ships with an updated Demo site with more ready-to-use features like&nbsp;<i>Places</i>. With 5.3, we have also placed a lot of energy in an improved documentation in many other features that will make it easier to anyone to get started.</p><p><i>There is plenty more in 5.3, we invite you to dive into further details, or get in touch:</i></p><table class="default" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="100%" style="width: 100%" summary="Call to Actions eZ Publish Platform 5.3"><tr class=""><td valign="top" style="vertical-align: top">

Their main mission is launching an e-commerce portal with a solid platform to build on. They need eZ Publish’s CMS strengths, and for e-commerce our opinion is that Sylius offers the best platform for this in combination with eZ Publish. This means that we must follow the development of both eZ and Sylius going forward, as well as Symfony2 as their common platform. I will also talk about pitching pre-alpha projects - it’s about as difficult as it sounds!</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

At Keyteq, the user is the main focus. It has to be easy. I’ll discuss pros and cons between different methods of integration - and as this is not a completed project, I’m open to both questions and ideas of how to go further, not simply in this project, also in general. I hope our way of integrating platforms will become something to build upon for others.</p><a name="eztoc406653_3" id="eztoc406653_3"></a><h2>Why did Keyteq decide to be a sponsor at this event?</h2><p>eZ Publish is our preferred CMS Platform for building online business for our client. Keyteq is the only Premium Partner in Norway and we have already made several large implementations of eZ 5.</p><p>Innovation is the key to Keyteq and for 10 years Keyteq has developed web products and concepts with online business as the main goal. Working with web content should be easy and intuitive and user efficiency will lead to better results. Working with eZ Systems, Keyteq has consistently proven its capabilities towards ever growing markets and networks.</p><p>Right now we’re working on a lot of exciting services and projects that blend in nicely with eZ platform. We want to improve and extend the reach of these as well as invent new solutions filling gaps. We are looking forward to even closer cooperation in this exciting network.</p><div class="align-center"><div class="download-button button button-link button-link-text  align-center ">

This means there needs to be much tighter level of collaboration between Development, QA, and Ops (buzzword alert: DevOps), but also Support as they need to work closely together with them all to be part of the workflow. It comes down to a several things, but mainly; standardizing on a configuration management system for deployment, on a Specification by Example/Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD) approach, software delivery via Composer and as we still mainly support on premise installations: automated compatibility testing.</p><a name="eztoc406270_2_1" id="eztoc406270_2_1"></a><h3>Background</h3><p>The reasons for all this is that in the past, and with “eZ Publish legacy” still present, acceptance &amp; compatibility testing of our software was too large degree manual work we usually refer to as certification. This is a no go when attempting to do any kind of continuous delivery or deployment (more about the concept in this document and in this one) , it is also a blocker for being able to open up more and eventually handling the whole release process, including testing, together with community. This way of testing was also taking quite some time for each of the 2 releases per year, resulting in 4 months each year being spent on stabilization. Most of which we can better use on churning out new exciting features together with the community, with high level of stability, continuously.</p><p>This certification effort has also regrettably caused us to reduce amount of platforms and version of myql/php/postgres/.. we were able to support per release over the years, since the effort to test on them where overwhelming. However if this compatibility testing was automated we could instead gradually increased amount of platforms and configurations we support instead, making it possible to run eZ Publish on the infrastructure you want.</p>

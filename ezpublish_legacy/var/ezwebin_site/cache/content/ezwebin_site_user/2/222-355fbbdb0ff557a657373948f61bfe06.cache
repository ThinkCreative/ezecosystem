      <p>A personal highlight for me was that almost all news publishers plan substantial investment to improve their digital channels. Most of the publishers understood that open integration frameworks provide many advantages because they are the glue between &quot;multi sources&quot; and &quot;multi channel&quot;. It turned out that Symfony 2 is for many publishers the first choice, because it is a powerful open source framework that has no vendor lock-in and great capabilities for effortless customisation. eZ Publish is the flagship Content Management and Customer Experience Platform entirely build on top of Symfony and therefore a genuine first choice for publishers deciding for Symfony.&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore eZ could convince with concept supporting the editorial newsroom. <a href="http://ez.no/Products/eZ-Market/Explore-the-eZ-Market/eZ-Live-Viewer" title="eZ Live Viewer" target="_self">eZ LiveViewer was for sure a highlight</a>, because the editorial team can see the popularity of the content offering in real time on a large screen in the newsroom and on the next large screen the popularity of the topics discussed in the audience.&nbsp;This is achieved by tracking and visualising the social media activities of the audience. Really cool was&nbsp;the eZ Live Viewer instance especially set up for the occasion, showing the World Publishing Expo's Tweets and trends.</p><p>eZ convinced publishers from all continents with its web to print approach. Digital first strategies are gaining momentum and eZ Partner opencontent showed how automating multi-channel content creation for digital first business. eZ OpenMagazine is a connector between eZ Publish &nbsp;and popular desktop publishing suites, like InDesign.&nbsp;</p>

      <a name="eztoc382385_1" id="eztoc382385_1"></a><h2>What a panel! They got it right when it comes to Digital and we surely can learn from them.</h2><p>In 3 talks we will hear from 3 major players in their fields about how eZ Publish was used to successfully go digital.</p>
<ul>

<li>The American Museum of Natural History, one of the top museums of New York City; one of the largest and most celebrated in the world, which I discovered to be much more than the cultural institution we all know it to be but a very serious Content organization.</li>

<li>The Financial Times, a major business and economic News company that has paved the way for the whole News and Publishing industry when it come to best practices for monetizing content online.</li>

<li>Madsack, a leading German Media company running a network of regional newspapers that anticipated, well in advance, of the coming digital disruption in the News industry, they’ve embraced it successfully, becoming one of leading media companies in Germany today.</li>

</ul>
<a name="eztoc382385_2" id="eztoc382385_2"></a><h2>This is not b%!@?! marketing.</h2><p>Yes, truly, I am usually the first to complain when our marketing at eZ is too shy or not good enough but for such an event, to be honest, the last thing I want is for this to be marketing driven and focused on us. As a user I don't like events led by vendors and having them monopolizing the slots with product evangelists or other industry “subject matter experts”! Well there will be nothing about that on October 16th. This event will be three use cases told by users, for other users to open further discussions with the attendees, without eZ really interfering more than anyone else in the presentations and discussions - period!</p><a name="eztoc382385_3" id="eztoc382385_3"></a><h2>It's all about people, and these are really sharp people!</h2><p>And yes, at the end of the day, we all know it is not so much about features and technology but about what you want to do with the technology and how you want to do it!! Good technology is a mandatory ingredient but nothing replaces good sound strategy, tactics and execution - you'll go nowhere without these. In that respect, we vendors, consultants, experts, developers all think we have a strong take on that, but nothing can beat the real feedback of smart leaders who figured out the digital recipe, getting it right, and executing on it from A to Z. That is what you will hear at this event!</p><p>In closing my last reason …(okay I had 4 reasons)...&nbsp;...would be that there are very few things nicer than a walk in Central Park on an early mid-October morning (or afternoon) and this event will provide you with that opportunity!</p><p>If you are interested you should rush to the events page and register, there is a limited number of seats open at this time!</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Roland</p>

      <a name="eztoc381689_1" id="eztoc381689_1"></a><h2>Crowd Sourced Magazine Production</h2><p>There were some neat concepts for crowd sourced production of Magazines from both Marjaana Toiminen (CEO Bonnier Publications) and Tarun Rai (CEO Worldwide Media). What a great way to expand your brand and build a community around your magazine brand. This is an example to follow for other publishers. Building a community around your brand is in my opinion the best way to create digital success.</p><a name="eztoc381689_2" id="eztoc381689_2"></a><h2>Digital first &nbsp;- Not so obvious</h2><p>There were much talk about going digital first and doing true multi-channel publishing. It seems like this is a fact of business for magazine publishers. But really when speaking to people it gets apparent that the publishers actually acting on this and re-inventing themselves for the digital first approach is not that common. Most are really still in the mode of print first and some digital on the side. Looking for others and what they have success with. Honestly a bit surprised that the owners of such great brands are not monetizing on their digital potential. Here there is a huge untapped potential for the publishers.</p><a name="eztoc381689_3" id="eztoc381689_3"></a><h2>Digital Monetization</h2><p>Why are most publishers still afraid of charging for content online? Magazine content is really not something they have to give away. This is the long standing debate on conferences like this, but really publishers must not be afraid of charging for their content combined with community building. I was expecting to see more discussions on what content to charge for and more a united front to put up pay-walls across the industry. Memberships to their online communities is something, when well designed, consumers will pay for. To make really unique online products the magazine publishers need to invest and not take shortcuts. Their brands are too valuable for this. So, I would advise: just start charging for your content.</p><a name="eztoc381689_4" id="eztoc381689_4"></a><h2>Are Publishers Flying Blind?</h2><p>Many publishers I talk to seem to be flying blind digitally. Journalists and editors really need to get better measurement tools and become more KPI driven. They are there to drive digital revenue and really need to understand what content and what digital efforts are paying off. It is not about buying traffic, as many are doing, but to understand how you can optimise the organic traffic they already have. Leverage the momentum stories get from social media and repeat success recipes etc. To do this they need the measurement tools that can empower their teams to focus on repeating and optimising digital success.</p>

      <p>Rome, September 23rd - 25th 2013: eZ Systems will join the 39th FIPP World Magazine Congress in Rome.</p><p>The FIPP World Magazine Congress is one of the largest and most high-profile magazine events in the world, bringing together magazine publishers and business media providers from across the globe. <a href="https://www.fippcongress.com/event/public/public_sponsors.aspx?sponsor_id=9" title="eZ Publish - FIPP Sponsor" target="_blank">eZ Systems will join the congress</a> and contribute to the question of what the digital business challenge is for magazine publishers and where eZ System can help.</p><p>Getting the right content onto the right platform, at a time when the platforms themselves are multiplying, has never been more complex. How do you ensure efficient management of editorial workflows, and what does this mean for content teams? To answer this question, eZ Systems Founder &amp; Chairman of the Product Innovation Board, Bård Farstad, will discuss business model strategies in his speech, during a special session on Content Management on the first day of congress. In the past, eZ Publish has solved the Multichannel Challenge and is now able to focus on digital business. The advantage of this is the ability not only to create content but also to publish it everywhere, thereby dissolving the borders between on- and off-line.</p><p>The congress will be held on September 23rd - 25th 2013 at the Hilton Cavalieri in Rome, where you will have the opportunity to meet Bård Farstad and Tony Wood (International Principal Consultant). To find out more, visit us at the FIPP Congress at stand No. 15. We look forward to seeing you in Rome.</p>

</div>
</div><p>First and foremost - a major change: eZ Live Viewer has significantly extended its memory range. In version 1.0 the solution aimed at providing insights on the real-time activity of the website. It looked back only a few minutes or hours. Listening to the end users, we learned that the screens and visualization techniques eZ Live Viewer offers would also be extremely useful when looking at the more distant past. So basically, we made this possible. Now you can simply click on the top right corner of the screen, open a drop-down list and choose the timeframe you want to look at: either now, today, yesterday, the current week or month or any previous period of your choosing…</p><p>(Note: of course we have not been storing any data in the past - version 3.0 marks the start of this method of data collection so if you are using the service already, we can't retrieve data from the past - sorry!)</p><a name="eztoc376690_2" id="eztoc376690_2"></a><h2>Added improvements on the article tiles</h2>

</div><p>In synch with this improvement, we brought a few minor changes to the article tile:</p><p>First off is a simple switch to be able to look at the article history or simply the latest trends, directly connected to the historical data feature above. Click either TOTAL or LAST to get the data you want to look at.</p><p>Next, on the graph showing the evolution of the trend of the article, we added small dots that indicate when the article was placed or taken out of the front page.</p><p>This status -- being featured on the front-page -- has also been added to the tiles by using a top-right white triangle corner. All tiles with this top-right white triangle are the one being featured on the front page at the moment.</p>

</div>
</div><p>We also added new information to the tile, which makes it even simpler to visually understand the activity on the site. We decided to use the <i>darkness</i> of the tile to represent the age of the content. The darker a tile is, the older the content. New content are shown the lightest. This is a minor change that makes the interface simpler and more intuitive for the editor.</p><p>Finally, another minor but important change - all information related to referrers (the left part of the home screen) are now based on visits instead of unique visitors. This is more coherent with the rest of the information displayed on the different screens.</p><p>We hope you will like this new version.&nbsp;If you are already a user, just log into eZ Live Viewer and check it out. If you are not yet, these are more reasons for you to reach out to us and ask for a demo, a trial or simply&nbsp;subscribe!</p><p>We think the Historical Data mode opens up a new type of usage for the tool which is great. For all the usability enhancements, we are really glad to keep optimizing the interface to stay ahead of competitors when it comes to visualizing web analytics. Be sure to expect more improvements in the future. The visual interface, flat and real-time, is not only a pleasure for the eyes, but it conveys more and more value to online marketers and editors without needing complex examination by a skilled analyst. This is the true value of eZ Live Viewer - making something others make hard, well, eZ. :)</p><p>--&nbsp;<a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/100387701195070391722?rel=author" target="_self">Roland</a>&nbsp;for the Product team at eZ</p>

      <p>There are a variety of options when it comes to content management. We’ve explored Drupal a bit, and in this email interview I talked to some folks who work with eZ Publish. It is an open source (with commercial options) CMS written in PHP. Brandon Chambers and Greg McAvoy-Jensen talk about how the platform acts as a content management framework, how being open source has affected the project, and what we should expect to see coming up for CMS in general.</p>

</div><p>Brandon Chambers is a Senior Developer at Granite Horizon, an eZ Publish integrator. He has 14 years of web development experience focused on open source technologies such as PHP, MySQL, Python, Java, Android, HTML, JavaScript, AJAX, CSS and XML.</p><p>Greg McAvoy-Jensen is a member of the eZ Publish Community Project Board. He also founded and is the CEO of Granite Horizon, and has been developing with eZ Publish since 2002.</p><p><b>Q: What problems does eZ Publish solve for users?</b></p><p>A: eZ Publish grew up not just as a CMS, but as a content management framework. It sports a flexible and object-oriented content model (an important early decision), and provides developers an MVC framework as a platform for building complex web applications and extending the CMS. Like any CMS it makes content publishing accessible for the non-programmer, and provides an easy editorial interface. eZ Publish does a fine job of separating content from presentation and providing reusability and multi-channel delivery. It targets the enterprise more than smaller organizations, so the software quality remains pegged at high standards, and high degrees of flexibility and extensibility continue to be required.</p><p><b>Q: How you feel being open source has affected the project?</b></p><p>A: Fourteen years on, eZ Systems is still firm that open source is in its DNA. This foundational commitment created a culture of sharing, and it attracts developers who prefer to share their code and to collaborate with others outside their organization for the benefit of their customers. Contributions flow in as both extensions and core code pull requests. The commercial open source model, similar to Red Hat’s, means the vendor takes primary responsibility for code maintenance and development, and derives its profit from support subscriptions, while leaving customizations to its network of certified partners. Because the source is open, organizations evaluating the software can have their developers compare the code of, for example, eZ Publish and Drupal, and make their own determinations. This, in turn, keeps the vendor accountable for the code: eZ engineers program knowing full well that the world can see their work.</p><p><b>Q: What distinguishes eZ Publish from other CMS options?</b></p><p>A: While there may be a thousand or so CMS’s around, analysts typically look at something more like 30 that are important today. eZ Publish fits into that group, most recently by inclusion on Gartner’s Magic Quadrant beginning in 2011. Not all open source CMS’s have a vendor behind them who both provides support and has full control over the code, a level of accountability required in enterprise applications. eZ is a great fit for particularly complex implementations, or situations where there is no assurance that future needs will be simple. And despite the complex customizations developers do with eZ Publish, they rarely interfere with upgrades.</p><p>eZ’s engineers recently became dissatisfied with the merely vast degree of flexibility they had built into the MVC framework, so they’ve now moved the whole system on top of the Symfony PHP framework. eZ Publish is now a native Symfony application, the only CMS to utilize Symfony’s full stack. This leverages the great speed and excellent libraries Symfony provides, and makes eZ easier to learn by those who are familiar with Symfony. Some CMS’s require many plug-ins just to get a basic feature set going on a site, but eZ Publish has long included granular security, content versioning, multi-language support, multi-channel/multi-site capability, workflows, and the like as part of the kernel.</p>

</div>
</div><p><b>Q: What do you see as the future of content management: where the field is going and what users and programmers can expect?</b></p><p>A: Over the last ten years we have seen many different flavors of CMS’s come and go, their features, user experiences, and editing workflows. We will see the blending of apps and websites together, creating a highly engaging user experience. Mobile websites built on top of a CMS will act as smooth web apps. The feature set of systems has expanded greatly with the dawn of the Web 2.0 and will become solidified to include out-of-the-box features instead of plugins without sacrificing performance.</p><p>CMS’s often tie together separate solutions for email marketing, marketing automation, client relationship management, social media engagement, website analytics, and the like, however this has created a mess for managing all the solutions. The single sign-on solution to one’s CMS has helped but that feature is still yet to be standardized. We will continue to see a more general, standardized integration across these different apps through REST APIs. CMS’s will act as a user’s central hub for all avenues of web engagement, without their knowledge that they are using separate applications. Editors’ lives will be made easier as they will be able to create publishing workflows for their business processes and be efficient online content engagement editors.</p><p>For CMS’s with APIs, opportunities to tie in mobile apps or server-based web applications will abound, without requiring full knowledge of the CMS. But for those developers responsible for the whole CMS, having more features and functions out of the box can also mean an increase in complexity for some, requiring more expertise (e.g. learning an entire framework) to manage one’s CMS. What it will mean for programmers is they will likely spend less time on small integration problems, custom apps, and features as they have been. Instead they will likely be required to turn their focus toward exotic and creative integrations, performance tuning, big data problems, and as a result web programmers will need to know more about design patterns. It will be very lucrative for programmers to master content management frameworks as they will take more time to learn.</p><p><i>This interview was edited and condensed.</i></p>

      <p>OpenMagazine is developed and offered by our trusted partner Opencontent. It's definitely a blast to see how the folks at <a href="http://www.opencontent.it/" target="_self">Opencontent</a> understand and use the eZ Publish platform, extending the possibilities our technology offers to build solutions that meet very specific needs and work elegantly on top of eZ Publish. &nbsp;This is what's happening with OpenMagazine's new version.&nbsp;Congratulations, Opencontent!</p><p>But let's stop with the foggy, fuzzy words and break into the concrete features of this new version. Let's look at why it should make you click if you have a need for publishing quality brochures, magazines, and documents in addition to your web presence.</p><a name="eztoc375002_0_1" id="eztoc375002_0_1"></a><h3>Mapping Indesign styles with your content types and structure</h3><p>First off: A major new feature is that OpenMagazine offers a new interface that's intuitive (and not technical) to define your &quot;mapping&quot;. Through the mapping, you tell the system how content information stored in your eZ Publish information architecture (aka the Content Classes) should fit into the layout structure of your Adobe Indesign templates. It's a crucial step in implementing a Web to Print solution. &nbsp;Until this second version, this had to be done by technical people in Adobe Indesign, as this was done by manual tagging in the Indesign files. &nbsp;Now, this is doable by editors from the CMS in a visual and user-friendly way! This is a major new feature that will streamline the process.</p>

</div><a name="eztoc375002_0_2" id="eztoc375002_0_2"></a><h3>Automating the production of a whole publication</h3><p>OpenMagazine Version 2 also comes with a desktop agent that will help you generate a whole publication (called 'an issue' in the print world). Let say you want to export a whole magazine issue to the print production when you're done with the editorial content. &nbsp;This is now possible &nbsp;thanks simple to this desktop agent. Before that, composition was handled manually at a further step in the process. The desktop agent is also smart, as it keeps synchronizing resources. This means that any changes done will be automatically be accessible to the layout designers/producers in the Indesign files with no need to log-in eZ Publish.</p><p>Again, it's all about streamlining the process and making it possible to manage a more complete and complex workflow with clear separation of tasks between designers (in Indesign) and editors (in eZ Publish), similar to what can be done using incopy.</p>

</div><p>Another new feature is that OpenMagazine fully supports the Adobe IDML format. This complete support gives more power to editors who can now use complex styling such as tables or chained paragraphs from eZ Publish itself.</p><p>Finally, OpenMagazine can also manage your fonts mapping. From eZ Publish, the editor can now define in a very granular way &nbsp;which fonts will be used in all styles in the Indesign document.</p><p>I might have missed a few enhancements and additional features, but this might be enough for now! OpenMagazine was already cutting edge, showing how to set up a full content management process across digital and print channels. It now just took a big new step in terms of completeness, enabling publishers to set up complex and efficient workflow that works for all those channels.</p><p>OpenMagazine fits publishing businesses (magazines, journals, newspapers) but also businesses of any kind that have publishing needs such as releasing brochures, reports, internal journals… who doesn't?!</p><p>If ever you have such a need, please feel free to reach out. OpenMagazine v2 will be shortly available, if it not already when you read those lines. The Opencontent and eZ teams would be more than happy to tell you about this solution and see how it can help you break the silos and build successful and efficient content workflow across channels!</p><p>-- <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/100387701195070391722?rel=author" target="_self">Roland</a> for the Product team at eZ</p>

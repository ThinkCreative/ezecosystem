</div><p>A number of very interesting presentations were given, some of my favorites being:</p>
<ul>

<li>“The Story of Symfony2 - innovation, passion, and openness” - this presentation was made by <a href="https://twitter.com/fabpot" target="_self">Fabien Potencier</a>, CEO of SensioLabs and a leading figure in the Symfony2 community. As eZ Publish is going to rely heavily on Symfony2 in version 5, everyone was very interested in hearing the story behind one of most popular PHP frameworks today.</li>

<li>“eZ Publish top-performance through mastery (and extension) of the cache layers” - a real gem provided by <a href="https://twitter.com/gandbox" target="_self">Gilles Guirand</a>, CTO of Kaliop. Anyone working with eZ on serious installations should hear Gilles talk about caching issues in eZ. The guy rocks. Totally.</li>

<li>“Published in 1885 and Shared on Facebook” - given by <a href="https://twitter.com/joekepley" target="_self">Joe Kepley</a> from Blend Interactive. A mix of both technical and management insights on a large project done in eZ Publish, this presentation reminded me of so many issues we experience while managing a web project and interacting with clients.</li>

</ul>
<a name="eztoc8657_2" id="eztoc8657_2"></a><h2>UnConference style</h2><p>The real change from the previous eZ Conference were the unconference sessions. I haven't attended such events in the past, and was interested if this participant driven style would work. And it did, very well.</p><p>The main idea here is that there is no enforced topic given upfront, so there is an internal voting procedure among participants which sets out the schedule. Most of the topics that emerged were (understandably) related to the upcoming v5 of eZ Publish and the transition process from v4. The impression is that we all will gain much with this upgrade, but there will also be much to learn. Interesting times ahead!</p><p>Other talks included a discussion on legal issues, content staging and even a much needed brainstorming session on the design issues of the administration interface (my colleague Vjeran also wrote <a href="http://share.ez.no/blogs/vjeran-vlahovic/8-suggestions-to-improve-the-administration-interface-experience" target="_self">a blog post on share.ez.no</a> related to this subject).</p><p>The only problem here was that there was so many interesting topics, and one had to choose which ones to attend.</p><a name="eztoc8657_3" id="eztoc8657_3"></a><h2>Symfony2 training</h2><p>
The final, post-conference day we were in Cologne, some of us took the chance to get introduced to Symfony2 web framework, which is one of the cornerstone technologies in the new version of eZ Publish. <br />The training was given by Sensio Labs and, even though it was only a short intro into the framework, it was enough to see the magnitude of changes after eZ Publish 5 gets fully implemented. Symfony2 brings a lot of value to eZ Publish and, coupled with other elements of the new stack such as the new Public API and the REST API, it will enable eZ developers to create some really cool stuff.</p><a name="eztoc8657_4" id="eztoc8657_4"></a><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>I think the new unconference style was a real win for a conference oriented mainly on the developers. A lot of attendees were more active in their participation instead of being just passive listeners to the talks, and the community feeling was much stronger than during classic, read-only events. We hope this will become a real tradition, and only grow in the years to come.</p><p>The location was really nice, Cologne being a really great place both for fun and business. The city itself, the Kölsch and the food were great and I hope to come again soon, either for business or leisure.</p><p>Finally, big congratulations go to eZ Systems team for organizing this event, and to all the community members who participated in the UnConference being such a success.</p><p>See you all next time!</p>

    <div class="attribute-body float-break">
      <p>Impossible, you say :) After a long year, when we first started development of version 2.0 of eZ Tags, we finally have something to show to the community. We know it shouldn’t have lasted this long, but what can you do... Sometimes a paying job just gets in a way :)</p><p>The last year was, mildly put, eventful for me. Progress on eZ Tags 2.0 started nicely and after couple of iterations of designing the multilingual variant of the extension (it was the toughest part of the new version), things actually started to work. But then, from beginning of this year, most of my time was reserved for Netgen’s collaboration with <a href="http://ez.no" target="_self">eZ Systems</a> on developing the new <a href="https://github.com/ezsystems/ezp-next" target="_self">Public API</a>, (which sometimes also included Saturdays and Sundays :)), so mostly, there was no time for eZ Tags, and in times when I managed to pull some free time, amount of work I wanted to do on the extension was overwhelming. Work was being done, albeit slowly.</p><p>This beta version was long coming too. Somewhat two months ago I decided that the time would be to do something about it, but again, time was a constraint. Lastly came the <a href="http://ezsummercamp.com" target="_self">eZ Summer Camp</a> where couple of people told me they’ve been using the multilanguage version of eZ Tags without any problems, so I finally decided that it’s time to release beta to a little larger audience.</p><a name="eztoc8629_1" id="eztoc8629_1"></a><h2>So, what's new in eZ Tags 2.0?</h2><p>Obviously, multilanguage tags :) I’m very well aware that there’s a real need for such functionality, so I gave my best to make it streamlined as possible: from how it looks in your browser, making sure that it’s easy to use, both for editors and developers, to how it’s implemented.</p><p>Whole core of eZ Tags was updated to work with multilanguage tags and what’s the best part, you don’t have to lift a finger to configure it. All settings for used and displayed languages are taken from exactly the same settings that eZ Publish uses for content objects and it just works. This includes the fetches, extended attribute filtering, eZTagsObject class interface, editing eZ Tags attribute, displaying it and so on. Not everything can be preserved of course, so due to huge code changes, there’s bound to be some backwards compatibility issues with your custom code that uses eZ Tags, so you should be prepared :)</p><p>Apart from multilanguage, we decided that version 2.0 would be the best time to overhaul the administration interface of eZ Tags which now looks and behaves exactly like the admin interface for content objects in eZ Publish. The admin interface now uses tabs to display different info for a single tag, just like when viewing a node. The list of tag children is updated to use the YUI datatable component, bringing it closer to how node children table works. The old design of children table is deprecated and disabled, but you can still use it if you wish, by modifying settings in eztags.ini file. This is mostly useful for eZ Publish 4.3 installations that don’t have all the required components for YUI datatable to work correctly. The overhaul of the administration interface is just a beginning. We have something more planned for the attribute edit interface of eZ Tags attribute, but let’s talk about that when the time is right :)</p><p>One other feature that was requested a lot found its way into this release: tags cloud over Solr. You can now use eZ Find and Solr faceting to display a list of tags in cloud view and as long as you have eZ Find activated and its schema.xml patched with eZ Tags specific fields, it should work, replacing the SQL code from the previous version of eZ Tags. To support tags cloud over Solr, a dedicated Solr indexing handler was added that can index more data than just plain tag names.</p><p>Apart from the mentioned features, eZ Tags 2.0 brings a lot of bug fixes and performance improvements (and some new bugs too, I’m sure :)) and all in all, we’re quite happy with what we did with it. Again, not all features that were planned for eZ Tags 2.0 made it in, otherwise it would never see the light of day, but they’re not forgotten and there will be 2.1, 2.2 and so on :)</p><a name="eztoc8629_2" id="eztoc8629_2"></a><h2>Testing and download</h2><p>To test the extension, you can download it from <a href="https://github.com/ezsystems/eztags/downloads" target="_self">GitHub downloads section</a>.

There are still some things to iron out, some todos left and so on. After all, that’s why it’s marked as beta :) For those of you who do want to use it, backup your installations and data beforehand to avoid any potential headaches. We simply ask you to try to use it as you would use the previous version, play around with it, check out the code, make some pull requests and of course, report any issues that you run into so we can have it rock solid when the time comes for a final release.</p>

      <p>Impossible, you say :) After a long year, when we first started development of version 2.0 of eZ Tags, we finally have something to show to the community. We know it shouldn’t have lasted this long, but what can you do... Sometimes a paying job just gets in a way :)</p><p>The last year was, mildly put, eventful for me. Progress on eZ Tags 2.0 started nicely and after couple of iterations of designing the multilingual variant of the extension (it was the toughest part of the new version), things actually started to work. But then, from beginning of this year, most of my time was reserved for Netgen’s collaboration with <a href="http://ez.no" target="_self">eZ Systems</a> on developing the new <a href="https://github.com/ezsystems/ezp-next" target="_self">Public API</a>, (which sometimes also included Saturdays and Sundays :)), so mostly, there was no time for eZ Tags, and in times when I managed to pull some free time, amount of work I wanted to do on the extension was overwhelming. Work was being done, albeit slowly.</p><p>This beta version was long coming too. Somewhat two months ago I decided that the time would be to do something about it, but again, time was a constraint. Lastly came the <a href="http://ezsummercamp.com" target="_self">eZ Summer Camp</a> where couple of people told me they’ve been using the multilanguage version of eZ Tags without any problems, so I finally decided that it’s time to release beta to a little larger audience.</p><a name="eztoc8629_1" id="eztoc8629_1"></a><h2>So, what's new in eZ Tags 2.0?</h2><p>Obviously, multilanguage tags :) I’m very well aware that there’s a real need for such functionality, so I gave my best to make it streamlined as possible: from how it looks in your browser, making sure that it’s easy to use, both for editors and developers, to how it’s implemented.</p><p>Whole core of eZ Tags was updated to work with multilanguage tags and what’s the best part, you don’t have to lift a finger to configure it. All settings for used and displayed languages are taken from exactly the same settings that eZ Publish uses for content objects and it just works. This includes the fetches, extended attribute filtering, eZTagsObject class interface, editing eZ Tags attribute, displaying it and so on. Not everything can be preserved of course, so due to huge code changes, there’s bound to be some backwards compatibility issues with your custom code that uses eZ Tags, so you should be prepared :)</p><p>Apart from multilanguage, we decided that version 2.0 would be the best time to overhaul the administration interface of eZ Tags which now looks and behaves exactly like the admin interface for content objects in eZ Publish. The admin interface now uses tabs to display different info for a single tag, just like when viewing a node. The list of tag children is updated to use the YUI datatable component, bringing it closer to how node children table works. The old design of children table is deprecated and disabled, but you can still use it if you wish, by modifying settings in eztags.ini file. This is mostly useful for eZ Publish 4.3 installations that don’t have all the required components for YUI datatable to work correctly. The overhaul of the administration interface is just a beginning. We have something more planned for the attribute edit interface of eZ Tags attribute, but let’s talk about that when the time is right :)</p><p>One other feature that was requested a lot found its way into this release: tags cloud over Solr. You can now use eZ Find and Solr faceting to display a list of tags in cloud view and as long as you have eZ Find activated and its schema.xml patched with eZ Tags specific fields, it should work, replacing the SQL code from the previous version of eZ Tags. To support tags cloud over Solr, a dedicated Solr indexing handler was added that can index more data than just plain tag names.</p><p>Apart from the mentioned features, eZ Tags 2.0 brings a lot of bug fixes and performance improvements (and some new bugs too, I’m sure :)) and all in all, we’re quite happy with what we did with it. Again, not all features that were planned for eZ Tags 2.0 made it in, otherwise it would never see the light of day, but they’re not forgotten and there will be 2.1, 2.2 and so on :)</p><a name="eztoc8629_2" id="eztoc8629_2"></a><h2>Testing and download</h2><p>To test the extension, you can download it from <a href="https://github.com/ezsystems/eztags/downloads" target="_self">GitHub downloads section</a>. We’re not ready to put it up on projects.ez.no just yet, as obviously we don’t want the community to start using it as a finished product, simply because it’s not. There are still some things to iron out, some todos left and so on. After all, that’s why it’s marked as beta :) For those of you who do want to use it, backup your installations and data beforehand to avoid any potential headaches. We simply ask you to try to use it as you would use the previous version, play around with it, check out the code, make some pull requests and of course, report any issues that you run into so we can have it rock solid when the time comes for a final release.</p>

      <p>Now, in 2014, we still believe in the value of open-source. We see the strong value an open content platform, with open source, open standards and powerful APIs can bring. We actually see it as being THE fundamental platform for modern digital business solutions.</p><p>When we started out, the perfect open-source business model did not exist. Other pioneers in open-source business models, such as Red Hat and MySQL, were not directly comparable as they provided low-level software like operating system and database, while eZ delivered both an application platform and a solution with its Content Management System and Framework.</p><p>The first version of our business model was based on selling services. We distributed our software, and sold services to support it. This, however, was not a scalable model, and software is not necessarily the same as a product. Nevertheless, it paid the bills and allowed us to grow and develop our software platform.</p><p>In 2007 we introduced the first version of our subscription services. At the time, it was still based on the same software with the same features for both community and subscribed versions. Value was provided through support and maintenance.</p><p>The next evolution introduced the software in two versions, where the <a href="http://share.ez.no/blogs/community-project-board" target="_blank">Community Project</a> had a monthly release for rapid innovative open development, and the <a href="http://ez.no/Products" target="_self">Enterprise edition</a> had two yearly releases based on the latest Community Project, but having undergone a full Quality Assurance process to make it Enterprise grade. These still came with support and periodic updates, critical bug-fixes and security packs.</p><p>When, in 2011, eZ took the step into the <a href="http://ez.no/Products/Digital-Marketing-Customer-Experience" target="_self">Customer Experience (CXM)</a> market, launching solutions for personalisation, recommendation, advanced analytics and, later, marketing automation, there was a differentiation in features between the Community Project and Enterprise subscription. The CXM solutions are delivered as a service and only available for the Enterprise subscription.</p><p>We have had a consistent average annual growth in subscription revenue of over 30% since 2007, and have learnt a lot from being a commercial open-source business model pioneer. We have learnt what is really valuable for our customers, what they are willing to pay for and how best we can deliver this. In the end, that is what all business is about: creating value that our customers are willing to pay for.</p><p>The first lesson is that what is of value to a business owner is what helps him improve his business, either by selling more or cutting costs. In truth, he does not really care that much about open source itself; rather, he cares about the value of reduced risk and cost, as well as improved flexibility from having a system capable of fulfilling his needs and solving his problems.</p><p>However, for the developers or integrators of digital business solutions, having the freedom and flexibility of open source does matter.</p><p>This brings us to the next evolution of our commercial open-source business model, aiming to simplify it through fine-tuning and make it more efficient. We will introduce a new commercial product on top of the open-source software platform we have been building over the last years. This new product will still be delivered as a subscription (including support &amp; maintenance) and will focus on features and services that really bring value to business users.</p><p>This product will be more integrated, more packaged, will provide better user experience and new capabilities to business users, and will rely completely on the open-source software platform that we are targeting with the next major version of eZ Publish - referred to (for now ;-) ) as ‘eZ Publish 6’.</p><p>So we will end up with two products: a 100% open-source platform, targeted toward developers, with APIs and user interfaces close to the current eZ Publish (for non-business end-users), and a commercial product based on this, targeted toward business owners and business users, that will by nature be more packaged and integrated, offering more business features, but that will be based entirely on the open-source platform AND be extensible relying on it.</p><p>The line is clear: simplicity and focus in our product portfolio, letting us bring more value to both business owners and developers via focused features and interfaces. The expected outcome is a reinforcement of our commercial open-source business model and of our competitiveness, as well as a boost in innovation and speed to market.</p><p>In an upcoming blog post we will elaborate on our new products and roadmap. Stay tuned...</p><p><sup><i>(Photos : <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/opensourceway/6555466069/" target="_blank">opensource.com</a>)</i></sup></p>

      <a name="eztoc397618_1" id="eztoc397618_1"></a><h2>#8 - More Content, More Interesting Content!</h2><p>Inbound &amp; Content Marketing will continue to thrive, likely to become a commodity for marketers, a given, the foundation on top of which the rest is built. Google's recent updates show the way towards focusing on content quality, subject matter editorial bits, rather than keyword stuffing or hijacking, and other (questionable) SEO practices. Organizations will have to tell engaging stories, in a qualitative way, to gain visibility in search.</p><a name="eztoc397618_2" id="eztoc397618_2"></a><h2>#9 - Segmentation: the New Mandatory Ingredient of Inbound Marketing</h2><p>As the attention span decreases year on year, the visitors' demands for relevancy steadily grows: &quot;the right content, to the right audience, on the right channel, at the right time&quot; will become pretty much the standard, rather than the aimed-at sophistication. Responding to this is grabbing the opportunity to support impulse buying and shorten the average conversion time. The challenge, however, is likely to reside in being great at that for the brand new suspects, whom we have not been nurturing, profiling and<a href="http://ez.no/About-eZ/Blog/Why-Should-I-Use-Segmentation-in-Marketing-Automation" target="_self">&nbsp;segmenting</a> already.</p><a name="eztoc397618_3" id="eztoc397618_3"></a><h2>#10 - From Big to Smart Data: Making Sense out of Petabytes</h2><p>
Smart Data = Big Data + Intelligence. A simple equation in which real-life usefulness comes from:<br />
1. The technological capability to capture a massive (and counting) amount of behavioral data every second, be it browsing tracking, order data, in-app journeys, cross-channel interaction. This part is well on its way,<br />
2. A clear idea of which key metrics should be monitored to successfully manage one's online business, and why they matter, tying them to customer intents &amp; behaviors - they probably make more sense when looked at as a whole rather than individually. This part is one of a marketer's/strategist's raison d'être,<br />3. A &quot;child's play&quot; type of way to consolidate them from different sources, consult them, compare them across segments &amp; in time, and consistently make business sense out of them. That's for the &quot;+&quot; in the equation, and this one will develop in 2014.</p><p>#11 - Several Reports of Marketer &quot;Insanity due to Channel Overdose&quot;</p><p>Until 2013 included, a solid marketer could endure the steady growth in amount of channels to deal with, or at least explore. That was without counting with the proliferating &quot;connected objects&quot;. We predict that several marketers will be admitted, in 2014, for treatment of acute &quot;Insanity due to Channel Overdose&quot;.</p><a name="eztoc397618_4" id="eztoc397618_4"></a><h2>#12 - Geo-marketing Will Extend its Reach</h2><p>...and will become a standard piece of metadata of content, like title and URL. The experience being the key point in engaging, relevancy and personalization shall continue to feed upon behaviour analysis of the target group(s) as well as of the individuals. Coming from a more &quot;traditional&quot; marketing (retail for instance), both static and dynamic geolocation will increasingly become parameters of online marketing systems. Static geolocation is the answer to &quot;where do you live?&quot;, quite common already but certainly more available today due to easy access to positioning data in (desktop) browsers, in a programmatic manner (as opposed to user-provided data, of unsure quality). Dynamic geolocation is the answer to &quot;Where are you now?&quot;, and using it implies proposing something valuable for You, where you are Now. A 1 EUR discount at the closest Starbucks: you get a push notification in your Starbucks app on smartphone….suddenly feeling like grabbing a quick coffee? A breaking news about a fire that started one block away, on your preferred newspaper's app...should I stop-by to check if the rescue teams need help for evacuating people?</p><p>While extracting sense out of a static picture is lots of guesses, &quot;getting&quot; movement seems easier. <a href="http://ez.no/About-eZ/Blog/eZ-Publish-5.3-One-More-Reason-To-Look-Forward-To-The-End-Of-Winter" target="_self">eZ Publish Platform 5.3</a> will be shipped with a demo based on Content Geolocation, letting you build <a href="http://www.yelp.com/" title="Yelp" target="_blank">Yelp</a>-like applications.</p><a name="eztoc397618_5" id="eztoc397618_5"></a><h2>#13 - &nbsp;The Rise &amp; Rise of Chief Digital Officers (CDOs)</h2><p>Chief Digital Officer will popup in Enterprise organizations, taking over CMO or CIO as really owning digital projects/business. Unlike well-spread rumors, we do not think CMOs will be the new CTOs on the long run (this was just a temporary phenomenon but it does not &quot;feel right&quot;): CDO will be the new one, leading online business.</p><a name="eztoc397618_6" id="eztoc397618_6"></a><h2>#14 - “The Content &amp; The Things” or &quot;The liberation of Content&quot;</h2><p>We have all been blown away by the Consumer Electronics Show (CES), once again this year: the breakthroughs in technology and usages were superlative, the new business opportunities appealing. Quickly following, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/13/google-just-bought-connected-device-company-nest-for-3-2b-in-cash/" title="Nest Acquisition Article" target="_blank">Google acquired Nest for $BN 3.2</a>. The obvious pattern is Connected Objects, otherwise called &quot;The Internet of Things&quot; when put together. These objects, often coming from the disruption of a common object by technology and addition of an internet connection, are right here, at the heart of our lives, and supposed to make it easier, or more efficient, or more fun….bring some sort of value.</p><p>They are, from a marketer standpoint, a new channel, and as for every channel, content is one of the ingredients of its relevancy. And to rise to the omnichannel challenge, an integrated multi-channel strategy will be required. There will be a key role for content in the Connected Objects ecosystem, and content delivery (pull AND push to content repository) will have to be enabled by the content management systems. eZ Publish Platform has already decided to liberate its content (read, write, update, etc) via a <a href="https://confluence.ez.no/display/EZP/eZ+Publish+REST+API" target="_blank">rock-solid REST API</a>, and is ready for &quot;The Content &amp; The Things&quot;.</p><p>And feel free to check out the first part of the&nbsp;<a href="http://ez.no/About-eZ/Blog/eZ-s-Marketing-Predictions-for-2014-Part-1-2" target="_self">eZ Marketing Predictions 2014.</a></p><p><a href="https://plus.google.com/+NicolasPastorino/posts" title="Nicolas' Google+" target="_blank"><i>Nicolas</i></a></p><p><i><sub>(Photo:&nbsp;<a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Nest_Thermostat.JPG" target="_blank">http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Nest_Thermostat.JPG</a>)</sub></i></p>

    <div class="attribute-body float-break">
      <p>So, this spring it will be the Ventoux release - eZ Publish Platform 5.3 - and here, in a nutshell, is what you can expect from it.</p><p>First, let's be more precise than ‘spring’: The 5.3 release is due in the last two weeks of May (stay tuned for the final date; we'll know very soon as we fine-tune our development and QA sprints). As introduced last year, 5.3 will be what we call a LTS release. LTS stands for Long Term Support. This means it will be supported until at least May 2017 (unlike, for instance, 5.2, which was a STS and only supported for the running year).</p><p>The primary goal of 5.3 is to help give users and developers a better grasp of the value of eZ Publish 5.x. We at eZ have often been good at developing very powerful features that are not known, not visible and sometime hard to find and understand for new users. With 5.0 and the following releases, we have been so focused on the architecture and the insides that we must admit we didn’t always make it easy or simple. We heard your feedback loud and clear, and decided to fix that issue.. One of the focuses for 5.3 (and 5.4) is to make it easier to understand and leverage the new architecture introduced with version 5, the ‘new stack’ relying heavily on the Symfony2 framework, and also the power of the dual kernel that we have with the 5 series.</p><p>The ‘business’ value of 5.3 will therefore be a combination of faster time-to-market (more user-friendly for development), better developer experience (many things are made easier and rely primarily on the new kernel and the Symfony framework), but also more affordability (especially considering learning and maintenance costs) and reliability. Of course, end-user experience will also be improved, as this is a continuous effort.</p><p>Beyond the value, if we look at the features we are working on, this translate into various requirements to achieve the above goal.</p><a name="eztoc396605_1" id="eztoc396605_1"></a><h2>Places, Premium content, and many small other things</h2><p>First, we are improving the demo site that ships with the eZ Publish Platform (also known as the Demo Bundle). This demo site can be use as a starting point; more importantly it is a collection of best practices that shows how to build and implement solutions on top of eZ Publish 5 and Symfony/twig in the front-end. So we want it to be more relevant, providing good examples of what can be done easily. For 5.3, this will translate into certain end-user features in the demo site such as ‘Places’, a more complete ready-to-use integration of the MapLocation field type to provide things such as a geolocalized search for places, better view online fo places, user-generated content to suggest places... all it takes to build your own Yelp (and based on the New Stack and Symfony).</p><p>Similarly, we are working on other features in the demo bundle such as management and delivery of Premium content, and better leverage of eZ Publish’s powerful roles and permission system. This was already ‘doable’ but needed developing; we simply want to make it easier and simpler for newbies with a ready-to-use front-end for it, which can be used, modified and customised.</p><a name="eztoc396605_2" id="eztoc396605_2"></a><h2>A stronger core platform with less dependency on the legacy kernel</h2><p>Second, but ultimately very related, is that we are continuing to remove strong dependencies on the legacy system and the old kernel (if you are lost when I use terms such as ‘dual kernel’, legacy system or new stack, you might want to read #&lt;<a href="https://confluence.ez.no/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=12125295" target="_self">doc link</a>&gt;## to better understand what this is all about. In short, it’s about backward and forward compatibility and the fact that eZ Publish 5 allows and partly relies on our old system, in order to make it possible for existing users to upgrade smoothly without breaking all previous developments and content). In this area, things such as authentication and user login, preview, and many other services will be totally migrated to the new kernel and new API, making it less important to rely on legacy, which in turn makes it far easier for developers just discovering eZ who don't want to learn our old system. In the same move, the Public and Rest API will be improved, with better coverage of all eZ Publish field types and improved functionality to make the API easier to develop with. Bridges and integration between new kernel and legacy will also be improved, making it easier to use both for end-users and developers.</p><p>Finally, there will be many other improvements. This covers a range of minor enhancements and bug fixes, but also several additions to the documentation - an area where we definitely want to speed things up as well, and for which we are deploying additional resources as we write this. Stay tuned - we'll be back soon with draft release notes, as well as alpha and beta releases.</p><a name="eztoc396605_3" id="eztoc396605_3"></a><h2>There is much more coming after 5.3</h2>

</div><p>The next release following 5.3 will be 5.4. It will come in November 2014 and will have a very similar drive to 5.3. One thing is important though: as you may know, it will also be followed very closely by the next generation of our platform, which will be based entirely on the new kernel. From that point on, we will no longer have any dependency on the old kernel and the upgrade path will be as smooth as possible. This is definitely a concern for us and we know it has been a strength of eZ Publish, compared with other solutions which ask their users every other year to toss all their work and start again, or go through a 'mission impossible' migration. This also is pure business value.</p><p>Please stay tuned; we’ll post more information soon about this new generation of our product, as we have lots of interesting things under way here.</p>

The stories that allow brands to get attention online, to grow their communities, to generate demand, traffic and leads, are the journeys towards a profitable conversion. Of the tools in the online business toolkit, content will become the prominent one, and virtually any organization will function like a publisher. Companies will need to adapt their organization, processes and tools. Learn more in <a href="http://ez.no/About-eZ/Blog/2014-The-Year-Where-Content-Means-Business" target="_self">Aleksander's blog post</a>, eZ's CEO.</p><a name="eztoc396295_2" id="eztoc396295_2"></a><h2>#2 - SEO, Content and Social Media Will Fully Blend</h2><p>Google Analytics now says (not provided) 100% of the time. Under cover of mindful privacy protection, AdWords is now the only way to have a precise idea of what the intent behind the search was (which keywords were used). The counterpart is that content quality matters even more, and will be positively rated by search engines, for SEO/SEM. Good content is content that spreads, thus social media channels represent an indicator of content quality. No coincidence behind the fact that <a href="http://ez.no/Products/Digital-Marketing-Customer-Experience/Marketing-Automation" target="_self">eZ Marketing Automation</a> now integrates a social media planner, at the heart of campaign management. This also means strong <a href="http://ez.no/About-eZ/Blog/Why-Should-I-Use-Segmentation-in-Marketing-Automation" target="_self">nurturing and segmentation</a> of one's contact base.</p><a name="eztoc396295_3" id="eztoc396295_3"></a><h2>&nbsp;#3 - Customer Journeys Increasingly Scattered Across Multiple Screens &amp; Channels</h2><p>From your website, to the responsive version of it, through your mobile or smart TV app(s), via physical touch-points (shopping walls for instance) and geo-marketed offers, your visitors have several dimensions, in parallel. Omnichannel. The word is unleashed.</p><p>This creates tough challenges for marketers who are willing to keep a holistic overview. Add to the mix the connected objects, consuming content APIs (REST), and your funnel will look like a highway junction, full of untapped opportunities. We confess, eZ contributed to this with solutions for plugging-in Smart TVs, seamlessly, with <a href="http://ez.no/Products/eZ-Market/Explore-the-eZ-Market/App-Web" target="_self">eZ App &amp; Web</a>, or integrating print channels (<a href="http://ez.no/Products/eZ-Market/Explore-the-eZ-Market/eZ-OpenMagazine" target="_self">eZ Open Magazine</a>). This comes on top of a strong multi-channel support in eZ Publish Platform.</p><a name="eztoc396295_4" id="eztoc396295_4"></a><h2>#4 - Marketing Becomes Accountable for Revenue Generation</h2><p>Tracking people from visit to customer is a Marketer's holy grail, often made difficult by the many distinct (digital) channels and the strong need of IT support. But unlimited marketing budgets are something of the past and the resulting benefits of marketing action will increasingly need to be proven. Tangible.</p><p>A part of the solution will come with connecting tools that are traditionally not really talking to each other, like your Marketing Automation suite and your CRM system. Or your Content Management System and your Marketing Automation suite. We try to help by providing a <a href="http://ez.no/Products/Digital-Marketing-Customer-Experience/Marketing-Automation" target="_self">Marketing Automation suite</a> that is integrated into eZ Publish Platform, and brings plug-ins for Salesforce.com and SugarCRM.</p><p>Related to that, we like this saying: &quot;If you're not measuring marketing, you're not marketing&quot;.</p><a name="eztoc396295_5" id="eztoc396295_5"></a><h2>#5 - A new species: &quot;Marketing Hackers&quot;</h2><p>In other words, Marketing departments will gear-up with engineering power, and new marketing profiles will appear: Marketing Hackers. Creating digital experiences requires more than just content: the context often must adapt. Going from revolution to evolution in marketing operations means that all stakeholders are sitting together, building the digital experiences in an integrated way: content, campaigns, platforms, graphical design, analytics. Marketing Hackers will bridge the gap with IT, and accelerate the transition towards agile, real-time marketing. We try to help here too by providing a <a href="http://ez.no/About-eZ/Events-News/News/eZ-Publish-Platform-5.2-Faster-Stronger-For-Your-Content-Business" target="_self">nimble content &amp; technology platform</a>, catering to the most demanding needs in terms of interoperability, extensibility, flexibility (APIs, Symfony2 full stack) and rapid deployment.</p><a name="eztoc396295_6" id="eztoc396295_6"></a><h2>#6 - Evolutions, Not Revolutions&nbsp;</h2><p>Continuous optimization of online business operations will become the core approach, as opposed to series of new big initiatives. This can happen at content-level with multivariate testing of several versions of a given piece of content during a short time after the content goes on air, with variations around the title, the SERP elements, the graphics, eventually leading to picking the most efficient version. This will also happen at a higher-level, through assessment of the performance of past tactics (relying on analytics tools and business outcomes), cutting some of them and strengthening the most fruitful ones. Optimization of practices, adjustments of tactics at a high-frequency will become part of online business people DNA, who will think agile, sprint and metric-oriented rather than waterfall, man-months and measure impact months later.</p><a name="eztoc396295_7" id="eztoc396295_7"></a><h2>#7 - Online Communities Fuel the Social Engine</h2><p>We quote <a href="http://www.cmswire.com/cms/customer-experience/the-future-of-digital-marketing-8-trends-023349.php" target="_blank">Vala Afshar's great article</a>, and share his view on this. Brands create, deliver and optimize content for their customers, closing the marketing loop and transforming the customer base into communities. They integrate their communities' voice into their brand stories, put conversational channels forward, and nurture their reputation also in online places which they do not own. The brand community experience, fueled by social interactions, content (own or user-generated), becomes an integral part of the purchase funnel: recommendation, reputation, peer influence and feedback are on stage, 24/7. Strategists will also need to add these communities as an input to their thoughts: they represent market intelligence, at the tip of their fingers.</p><a name="eztoc396295_8" id="eztoc396295_8"></a><h2>Stay tuned</h2><p>...the rest of our predictions are coming-up soon!</p><p><a href="http://google.com/+NicolasPastorino" title="Nicolas Pastorino on Google+" target="_self">Nicolas</a></p>

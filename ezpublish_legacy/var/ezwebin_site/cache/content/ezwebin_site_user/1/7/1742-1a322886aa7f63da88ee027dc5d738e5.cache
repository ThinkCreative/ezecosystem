This means it will be supported up to end of May 2019 with extended support, you have time to plan further upgrade! (see <a href="http://support.ez.no/Public/Service-Life" title="eZ Publish Platform Support Service-Life description" target="_blank">http://support.ez.no/Public/Service-Life</a> for details on the supported period). It is a technical release that provides new features and opportunities for developers to build great things, more solidity and ease-of-use. It mostly offers a continuous improvement of the &quot;Platform stack&quot; introduced with eZ Publish Platform 5 (previously referred to as &quot;New Stack&quot;, based on Symfony2) in terms of features, usability and performance.</p><a name="eztoc407019_2" id="eztoc407019_2"></a><h2>Making it Easier For Developers to Understand And Learn</h2>
<div class="object-right"><img src="http://ez.no/var/ezflow_site/storage/images/media/images/symfony-framework-at-the-heart-of-ez-publish-platform-5.3/407183-1-eng-GB/Symfony-Framework-at-the-heart-of-eZ-Publish-Platform-5.3_large.png" alt="Symfony Framework at the heart of eZ Publish Platform 5.3" /></div><p>We heard our community, eZ Publish Platform was a big step forward in terms of technology, but we might have focused too much on the capabilities, without making sure it can be easily grasped by newcomers to the platform or to the Symfony framework. With 5.3, we have placed a lot of energy in an improved documentation in many other features that will make it easier to anyone to get started.</p><a name="eztoc407019_3" id="eztoc407019_3"></a><h2>Making it Easier For Developers to Develop And Deploy</h2><p>One of the main line of 5.3 release has been to drastically improve the integration of the Symfony environment, the capability to easily build websites relying on the &quot;eZ Platform&quot; stack (&quot;New Stack&quot;) and continuously remove dependencies on the legacy stack (4.x). With 5.3, while it is still possible to use the legacy stack and templating system (with the dual-kernel architecture), the main way to go is to use the new platform and the Symfony framework. There is also another major change that will make developers and operation people’s life way easier: eZ Publish Platform 5.3 relies now entirely on Composer -- the now standard deployment and dependency manager tool for PHP. We moved from our previous proprietary deployment tool in eZ Network to fully embrace Composer as a system to deliver updates, making it very standard, very easy and very efficient!</p><a name="eztoc407019_4" id="eztoc407019_4"></a><h2>Updated Demo Site With More Ready-to-use Features Like Places</h2><p>The Demo Site has been improved to progressively become the reference for developers to see how features of the platform can be used to build great Websites. Among many improvements to the previous demo site, we added a ready-to-use feature called Places that shows how to best deal with geolocation and how to search on geolocated data thanks to the latest improvement in the eZ Publish API and in SolR. In short, the Places feature show you how you can quickly create your own listing of places and display them efficiently, whether you want to show the many locations of your company or build your own Yelp guide.</p><div class="separator"><span></span></div>

Here’s what you can expect:</p><div class="separator"><span></span></div><a name="eztoc407019_5_1" id="eztoc407019_5_1"></a><h3>Use of Doctrine DBAL / DoctrineBundle</h3>

Your benefits:</p>
<ul>

<li>Well-known/standard way of using databases from a Symfony2 application,</li>

<li>Better performance by potentially reducing the amount of open database connections,</li>

<li>Full access on DB-level debug info, right from the Symfony Web debug toolbar.</li>

<ul>

<li>Well-known/standard way of managing authentication in a Symfony2 application,</li>

<li>Allows to use various login or SSO handlers available in the Symfony community,</li>

This feature supports deployment of multilingual websites by making it easy to build, from Twig and Symfony2, a widget for visitors to switch language during navigation. This comes in a continuity of the <a href="http://ez.no/5.2" title="eZ Publish Platform 5.2 release" target="_self">5.2 release</a> improvements that increased the amount of usable languages from 30 to 62. A by-product of this is the ability to easily create links from one siteaccess to the other (including across language siteacesses). Your benefits:</p>
<ul>

<li>Support of multi-language/international deployments,</li>

<li>Clean, supported way of linking across siteaccess,</li>

Our experience working with Polish computer scientists has been great, so we are confident we have made the best decision.<br />
For the new office, the position of General Manager of eZ Systems Polska Sp. z o.o. has been offered to and accepted by Mr Łukasz Serwatka, an experienced developer and product manager who has long been part of eZ. Mr Serwatka describes his plans for the future: “The Polish branch of eZ Systems will continue to develop the eZ product portfolio, with a focus on front-end and innovative user interfaces. For that we are planning to build a new project team, with at least six members before year end. We are currently looking for candidates for the positions of Junior &amp; Senior UI Developers.”<br />After Skien (NO), Lyon (FR), Oslo, Paris, Cologne (DE), Tokyo and New York, the Katowice branch is another step in our global development. The new team will work closely with the rest of the engineering team in Lyon and the product team in Brooklyn, New York, and will help us develop new features and improve our products and services.

</div><p>Rapidly changing business requirements being a standard of the digital industry, the technological choices made must respond quickly to constraints. A scalable platform, with integrated multi-site support at the heart of the system, is a way to ensure that deploying a new site is an incremental project from a technology set-up perspective; a lightweight task compared with setting up a new instance of the product. This is now enabled, in eZ Publish Platform 5.2, by a reinforced&nbsp;<a href="#DownloadBrochure" target="_self">multi-repository Storage and Cache system</a>&nbsp;allowing full flexibility in content sharing and reuse across multiple sites, on a single installation architecture.</p><p>In a similar vein of cost-efficient response to changing business requirements, we augmented multi-lingual capabilities by raising the bar of 30 supported languages in version 5.1, <a href="#DownloadBrochure" target="_self">to 62 in version 5.2</a>,&nbsp;Aconcagua, for one single installation.

These APIs are backwards compatible for several years, securing your developments in time (add-ons to eZ Publish Platform, extensions). The big novelty: with 5.2, we ship a Javascript-based client to speed up the creation of your client-side apps (mobile, rich client, web), assisting you on both sides of the multi-channel story: back-end and client-side. On top of this, both the PHP &amp; REST APIs were consolidated, repositioning them as high-standard tools for thorough content manipulation.</p><div class="separator"><span></span></div><p><a href="http://ez.no/Forms/HTML-forms/Discover-eZ-Publish-Platform-5.2" title="Book an eZ Publish Platform 5.2 Demo" target="_self"><a href="http://ez.no/Forms/HTML-forms/Discover-eZ-Publish-Platform-5.2" target="_self" title="Book an eZ Publish Platform 5.2 Demo"><img src="http://ez.no/var/ezflow_site/storage/images/media/images/book-an-ez-publish-platform-5.2-demo/390472-1-eng-GB/Book-an-eZ-Publish-Platform-5.2-Demo.png" alt="Book an eZ Publish Platform 5.2 Demo" /></a></a></p><div class="separator"><span></span></div><a name="eztoc390420_2_7" id="eztoc390420_2_7"></a><h3>Consolidating eZ Publish Platform 5 “New Stack”, Symfony first!&nbsp;</h3>

</div>
</div><p>As with all 5.x versions, this release relies on a dual kernel architecture. This means that the new eZ Publish 5 architecture, which relies on strong APIs and Symfony Web Framework “Full Stack”, coexists in the same software with our Legacy architecture, making eZ Publish Platform 5 unlike any other CMS - powerful, modern, scalable, and fully extensible.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>
This dual kernel architecture has been designed and developed to facilitate both the upgrade from earlier versions and the adoption of eZ Publish Platform 5 series to existing users of eZ Publish Platform. All development done on eZ Publish Platform 4 versions can easily be transferred, and all knowledge and skills in eZ Publish Platform 4.x can still be leveraged without any gaps.&nbsp;<br />

<a name="DownloadBrochure" id="DownloadBrochure"></a><br />With 5.2, the coverage of the new kernel (aka New Stack) has been significantly extended and consolidated. This makes it the version where the New Stack should, most often, be the preferred choice when developing new sites.&nbsp;</p><div class="separator"><span></span></div><a name="eztoc390420_3" id="eztoc390420_3"></a><h2><b>Full Feature List:&nbsp;What’s new in the eZ Publish Platform 5.2?</b></h2><p>Fifteen new features and more than 129 bug fixes and improvements to the core platform.</p><p>eZ Publish Platform version 5.2 is a significant step forward for the core platform, with numerous improvements and bug fixes, both in the new Symfony-based framework and in the public and REST API.

</div>
</div><p>eZ Publish Platform 5.0 generated a lot of enthusiasm and interest. With this new release, it takes the discussion to the next phase. While engineers worked on 5.1 they focused on making the software platform more solid, more mature, more scalable and much faster.</p><p>As with the preceding 5.0 version, 5.1 is also based on the dual kernel approach whereby the legacy system is used for the editorial user interfaces, the content repository and all the power of the full featured content management system; while the new stack adds on top a complete set of APIs (REST and PHP) as well as a brand new web framework based on Symfony2.</p><p>The highlights of the new benefits for developers are:</p>
<ul>

<li>The fastest eZ version ever thanks to the Symfony web framework and the improvements of Symfony 2.2</li>

</ul>

<ul>

<li>A redesigned cluster support for high traffic websites, which now makes it possible to run with the new kernel of the platform in a cluster setup as much as with the legacy version.</li>

<li>Improvement of the eZ Publish 5 REST API with new support for sessions and XSRF</li>

<li>A new data cache system that enables you to multiply performance of website when operating in dynamic mode</li>

<li>Full support for the multi-site management feature in the new web framework</li>

<li>The support in the new kernel for new field types including the rendering of eZ Flow landing pages</li>

<li>New completed demo sites, a cookbook, improved documentation and tutorials.</li>

</ul>
<p>For more information, a full list of the improvements, bug fixes and new features brought to the eZ Publish core platform is available in the <a href="http://ez.no/About-eZ/Blog/eZ-Publish-5.1-Platform-at-a-glance-Release-Notes" title="eZ Publish 5.1 Platform at a glance - Release Notes" target="_self">technical release notes</a>.</p><p>“eZ Publish version 5.0 represented a bold new direction for the platform that has brought a lot of great new abilities while still maintaining backward compatibility. Release 5.1 continues this by quickly maturing the new platform architecture and enabling even more Symfony-based eZ Publish projects.” said &nbsp;<a href="http://share.ez.no/community/profile/9901" title="Joe Kepley member of the eZ Publish Community" target="_blank">Joe Kepley</a> - <a href="http://ez.no/Partners/Find-a-Partner/Blend-Interactive" title="Blend Interactive" target="_self">Partner at Blend Interactive</a> , a USA eZ Systems partner.</p><div class="separator"><span></span></div><a name="eztoc362365_2" id="eztoc362365_2"></a><h2>A more integrated platform approach for business to build digital experience</h2><p>eZ has also been working on the components related to the customer experience management (CXM) side of the platform. Here, the focus is to provide a much more integrated platform, making it easy to combine the different pieces of the Digital Experience - the content and its platform at the core.</p>

</div>
</div><p>This way, 5.1 brings a few significant steps forward:</p>
<ul>

<li>eZ Marketing Automation is improved, offering more integration to bridge content management and marketing automation such as advanced use of online marketing forms within the CMS, ability to run web nurturing campaigns or simply improved management of landing pages.</li>

<li>eZ Recommendation service has been significantly enhanced, facilitating the way web developers can configure the extension in their website and providing more accurate tracking capabilities.</li>

<li>eZ Liveviewer 2, the real-time analytics solution, was significantly updated with a new front page monitoring feature able to recommend editors which content to more efficiently promote. It has also been re-implemented fully in HTML5 and is now tablet compliant meaning you can monitor your live traffic and content trends on the go.</li>

</ul>
<p>eZ odoscope has also been fine tuned with tighter integration and performance enhancements.</p><a name="eztoc362365_3" id="eztoc362365_3"></a><h2>eZ Publish Cloud for better time to market and total cost of ownership</h2><p>With 5.1, the cloud deployment service is now integrated as a core component of the platform subscription itself. When a customer subscribes to the eZ Publish Platform today, they also get access to a cloud environment, ready for deployment as part of the service. Charges are then only incurred for the usage of the infrastructure. This is the eZ elastic way!</p><p>Not only will developers like it for the ease of use, but more importantly, their bosses and business owners will appreciate the combination of the radically reduced time to market for new projects to reach production, the reduced infrastructure cost and the pay-only-for-what-you-use model that puts them in greater power.</p><a name="eztoc362365_4" id="eztoc362365_4"></a><h2>eZ Publish dual kernel for smoother migration path and better sustainability</h2><p>While eZ Publish 5 includes a brand new architecture with many benefits, it also fully supports and relies on the old architecture which we call the “Legacy System”. The Legacy System remains a core component of the 5.x series. Existing eZ Publish users can benefit from version 5.1 at very low cost, and can be sure the “old way” of doing things is still possible. For instance, using the old templating system or older extensions. It is important to recognise that the adoption of the new components in eZ 5.x is not mandatory from day one, it can be a progressive build into the new technology.</p><p>“<i>As a software company we have to invest as much effort in developing new features as servicing our existing customer base and offering them true reliability and sustainability</i>” says Aleksander Farstad, CEO of eZ Systems.</p><p>“<i>While people often remember only new features, a lot of the success for our customers comes with our attention to remain predictable and to offer a sustainable development path. That is what we offer with 5.1: a very smooth and flexible migration path, a long term support plan and full backward compatibility with content and existing data.</i>”</p><p>To further demonstrate the commitment to sustainability, eZ Systems provides a full roadmap for the coming years, and welcomes contributions and feedback on the innovation process with an open development process. The goal is to ensure that existing users can understand, evaluate and decide upon their own project’s roadmap and even influence eZ’s software development roadmap itself!</p><a name="eztoc362365_5" id="eztoc362365_5"></a><h2>Availability</h2><p>eZ Publish 5.1 is available immediately, under a hybrid delivery model (in the cloud and for download as part of the same package).

It continuously measures the performance of your front-page and recommends changes that will directly improve your conversion and engagement rate. For marketing and commerce oriented sites this can be measured in direct revenue gains; for publishers it increases traffic, boosts reader engagement and advertising revenue, for service related sites it improves content relevance and efficiency. This tool is not about simply measuring page views but really about analyzing in detail how the front-page and the content being pushed on it behaves and delivers.</p><div class="">

      <p>Ms Viebach held the position of CEO from 2010. During her tenure, the firm’s software product, eZ Publish, has evolved from a popular open source website publishing software to becoming a global contender in the emerging sector of &quot;CXM&quot; (customer experience management) software suites. The platform today allows interoperability across IT infrastructure and integrates several digital technologies in order to streamline, build and optimize digital businesses and enable next generation digital needs.</p><p>Under Viebach, eZ Systems further matured towards an enterprise grade organization and the services offerings were further evolved. The offering to customers as well as System Implementation partners across the globe was sharpened, resulting into a significant growth of eZ´s subscription-based business. A stronger network of over 350 system integrator- and Media Agency partners across the globe attracted this offering. Gabriele now leaves eZ Systems to apply herself to a new task.</p><p>Aleksander Farstad, co-founder of eZ Systems, was CEO until 2008. Since that time he continued to serve as an active Board member. He looks forward to continuing to build on the dynamic business that eZ Systems has become today, which serves the digital development needs of several of the most innovative companies and public sector organizations in the world today.</p><div class="separator"><span></span></div><p><b>Contact:</b></p><p>

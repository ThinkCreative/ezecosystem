It continuously measures the performance of your front-page and recommends changes that will directly improve your conversion and engagement rate. For marketing and commerce oriented sites this can be measured in direct revenue gains; for publishers it increases traffic, boosts reader engagement and advertising revenue, for service related sites it improves content relevance and efficiency.

      <p>Ms Viebach held the position of CEO from 2010. During her tenure, the firm’s software product, eZ Publish, has evolved from a popular open source website publishing software to becoming a global contender in the emerging sector of &quot;CXM&quot; (customer experience management) software suites. The platform today allows interoperability across IT infrastructure and integrates several digital technologies in order to streamline, build and optimize digital businesses and enable next generation digital needs.</p><p>Under Viebach, eZ Systems further matured towards an enterprise grade organization and the services offerings were further evolved. The offering to customers as well as System Implementation partners across the globe was sharpened, resulting into a significant growth of eZ´s subscription-based business. A stronger network of over 350 system integrator- and Media Agency partners across the globe attracted this offering. Gabriele now leaves eZ Systems to apply herself to a new task.</p><p>Aleksander Farstad, co-founder of eZ Systems, was CEO until 2008. Since that time he continued to serve as an active Board member. He looks forward to continuing to build on the dynamic business that eZ Systems has become today, which serves the digital development needs of several of the most innovative companies and public sector organizations in the world today.</p><div class="separator"><span></span></div><p><b>Contact:</b></p><p>
